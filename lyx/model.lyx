\begin_layout Abstract
This paper estimates a lifecycle model of consumption, housing choice and
 migration in the presence of aggregate and regional shocks, using the Survey
 of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).
 Using the model I estimate the value of the migration option and the welfare
 impact of policies that may restrict mobility.
 The option to move is equivalent to 4.4% of lifetime consumption.
 I also find that, were the mortgage interest-rate deduction to be eliminated,
 the aggregate migration rate would increase only marginally by 0.1%.
 Following a general equilibrium correction, house prices are reduced by
 5%, which results in a 1% increase in home ownership.
 In a new steady state the elimination of the deduction is equivalent to
 an increase of 2.4% of lifecycle consumption.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Households are subject to many types of shocks, such as aggregate shocks,
 regional shocks and idiosyncratic shocks.
 As the recent crisis painfully reminds us, regional shocks to wages and
 house prices can be deep and prolonged.
 This paper develops and estimates a structural model with aggre- gate and
 regional shocks to wages and house prices in a life-cycle setting, in which
 households can insure against these shocks by migrating to another region,
 saving, and buying or renting a house.
 The model is estimated to match key moments from the Survey of Income and
 Program Participation (SIPP) related to mobility and homeownership across
 regions and by age.
 This framework helps evaluate the costs of regional shocks and the benefits
 of the various channels of self-insurance, thus also helps to inform policy
 reforms that affect the costs of these self-insurance mechanisms, including
 changing the costs of owning a house and moving.
 The estimated model implies that, while yearly mobility flows across regions
 are small, mobility is a very valuable option.
 In fact, were we to prevent the residents of a certain region from moving
 away, their expected lifetime utility falls by 5.1% and they would demand
 a 4.4% increase in period consumption for compensation.
 The model also finds that, were the mortgage interest-rate deduction eliminated
, the aggregate migration rate would increase only marginally by 0.1%.
 Using a general equilibrium correction, house prices are reduced by 5%,
 which results in a 1% increase in ownership.
 Redistribution of tax receipts towards poorer households and lower prices
 everywhere increase the incentives to exploit regional differences, which
 changes migration behaviour.
 Individuals value the elimination of the deduction by 2.4% of period consumption.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Homeownership and the likelihood of moving across regions are negatively
 correlated.
 This negative correlation has important implications when considering the
 insurance mechanisms available to consumers in the face of regional shocks
 to housing and labor productivity in a world of incomplete markets.
 The possiblity of moving to another region in the event of a shock is a
 way to self-insure against tail risk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aims of this paper are first to investigate the value of this self insurance
 mechanism, second to analyse the reaction of regional mobility to regional
 shocks and third to establish how important government policies such as
 the mortgage interest tax deduction, which encourages ownership, interact
 with regional migration.
 To address those issues, I propose a lifecycle model of consumption and
 savings, housing tenure and location choice, with aggregate uncertainty
 which affects prices in regions differentially.
 Migration serves as a partial insurance device because regions are exposed
 to aggregate shocks to a different degree, consistent with the observed
 data.
 The lifecycle considerations have important implications for the analysis
 of welfare impacts of policy changes, since age groups are differentially
 affected.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regional shocks to labor demand and house prices may have profound and longlasti
ng impacts, as we are still witnessing in the aftermath of the 2007 fall
 in house prices and ensuing Great Recession.
 In this episode we have seen wide variation in the magnitude of local shocks
 despite underlying high national correlations.
 For example, the peak-to-trough decline in the Federal Housing Financing
 Agency (FHFA) house price index from 2007 to 2011 ranged from -2.3% in Pittsburg
h, to -61% in Las Vegas.

 The decline of the automobile industry in Detroit provides a vivid example
 of the effects of a permanent shock to labor income in a region: from the
 1950 to the 2010 censuses, the population of Detroit declined by 61%.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shocks to regional labor demand affect renters and owners in a similar way,
 i.e.
 labor income of both falls.
 The effects of a fall in house prices is more nuanced, since renters stand
 to benefit from cheaper rent, if this is related to prices, while owners
 may loose wealth invested in the house.
 Furthermore, if house prices reflect the value of local amenities in some
 kind of way, the location becomes less attractive for renters as well as
 for owners.
 For those reasons, we should expect to see different reactions in the mobility
 of renters and owners in response to different shocks.
 Labor market shocks should make both types more likely to leave the region,
 while price shocks could have differential impacts, depending on the relative
 importance of cheap rents, low value housing asset, lower amenity values,
 and moving costs for renters and owners.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 2013, 63% of occupied housing units in the US were owned, while 37% were
 rented.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
see American Community Survey 2013, table DP04.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 At the same time, roughly 1.3% of the population migrate across US census
 division boundaries per year.
 Conditioning on ownership we find that 1.9% of renters and 0.67% owners move.
 A natural question is then to ask why do we observe owners moving less?
 All else equal, owners face higher moving costs, both in terms of financial
 as well as time and effort costs.
 Financial costs occur because of transaction costs in the housing market
 upon sale of the house (e.g.
 agency fees or transaction taxes), while costs of effort arise from owners
 having to spend time finding a suitable buyer, meet with agents and lawyers
 etc.
 A comparable renter is subject to those costs only to a lesser degree.
 Buying a house means to make a highly local financial investment, which
 is subject to shocks as discussed above, is relatively illiquid, and in
 addition may have a location specific flow of utility.
 Consumers may have preferences for locations.
 These factors interact to shape the joint decision of housing tenure, location
 choice, and mortgage borrowing.
 What is more, they all interact to influence the decision to move in response
 to a shock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the model I develop, there are several mechanisms which affect the home
 ownership choice of individuals.
 A downpayment requirement means that only individuals with sufficient cash
 on hand are able to buy a house at the current price.
 The model assumes a preference for owner-occupied accomodation, which also
 influences the buying decision next to age, the probability of moving,
 and beliefs about future shocks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of the decision to migrate to another region, the model predicts
 that the likelihood of migration is increasing in the difference of discounted
 expected lifetime utilities between any two regions.
 Those relative utilities, in turn, depend among other things on the average
 regional income level and the level of regional house prices, both of which
 vary over time.
 Allowing regional characteristics to vary is a significant contribution
 to the literature on dynamic migration models such as for example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kennan2003effect"

\end_inset

, since it provides an additional reason for agents to move in response
 to a change in their economic environment, rather than as a result of idiosyncr
atic preference shocks alone.
 Including time-varying location characteristics, however, increases computation
al demands substantially.
 To keep those demands tractable, the model employs a factor structure which
 allows aggregate shocks to affect regions differently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I estimate the model using a simulated method of moments estimator.
 I find that the model fits the data very well along the main dimensions
 of interest, which are mobility and ownership patterns over the lifecycle,
 ownership rates by region, as well as wealth accumulation over the lifecycle
 and by region.
 After fitting the model to the data, I first illustrate how adding ownership
 and assets to a dynamic migration model affects behaviour.
 I then show how the model reacts to large regional shocks, before I move
 on to compute a measure of the value of the migration option.
 Finally, the model is used to perform counterfactual policy simulations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I find that owners and renters face very different incentives in the model.
 The probability of moving conditional on being a renter is consistently
 higher than the one for owners, and it varies considerably with income
 and assets.
 The model can be used to quantify the moving cost in terms of dollars,
 and I find that the estimates for renters and owners bracket the moving
 cost obtained in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Migration is a low probability event in both data and model.
 Nevertheless, the welfare implications are large.
 I conduct an experiment whereby moving away from a certain region is prohibited.
 I compute the expected lifetime utility of agents in the region under both
 scenarios, and I find that removing the option to move away from the region
 reduces expected utility by 5.1%.
 This implies that residents of this region would demand a 4.4% increase
 in per period consumption over their lifecycle in order to be indifferent
 to the baseline environment.
 Conditioning on age when computing expected utility reveals that the cost
 of not being able to move is largest for younger individuals, and it gradually
 fades out as agents grow older.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Government policies might help to increase labor market efficiency, housing
 market inefficiency or both.
 The main inefficiencies any policy might target are incomplete asset markets,
 liquidity constraints, moving and transaction costs, income taxes and imperfect
 rental markets.
 One large pre-existing intervention in this context is the mortgage interest
 deduction.
 It is interesting to consider how abolishing this tax deduction might interact
 with borrowing, housing tenure choice and migration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I find that abolishing the mortgage interest deduction would have a only
 a negligible impact on the aggregate migration rate.
 At first sight one might be tempted to think that removing the deduction
 would result in more renters, which would mechanically translate into an
 increase in migration, since renters move more.
 The actual effect is more nuanced.
 First, because the mortgage tax deduction is a large scale policy, there
 is likely to be a general equilibrium effect.
 While my model is a partial equilibrium model, I can approximate the general
 equilibrium effect by assuming that the policy changes both taxes as well
 as prices.
 I use recent results from a stationary GE model by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "sommer2013implications"

\end_inset

 who find that house prices fall, while rents keep constant, after the policy
 is changed.
 Applying this price and rent correction to my model results in an increase
 in the ownership rate of roughly 1%, because more households are able to
 buy at lower prices.
 The net effect on migration is very small (0.1% of the baseline rate).
 The reduction in mobility is smaller than what we would expect from a pure
 change in composition towards more owners, because migration behaviour
 changes as well.
 Lower prices and a higher level of disposable income for the poor after
 redistribution of tax proceeds in all regions change the incentives to
 exploit regional differences with respect to the baseline.
 In terms of welfare, households prefer removing the deduction and would
 agree to giving up 2.4% of period consumption before being indifferent to
 the status quo.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main differences to this paper are the way I model regional price and
 income dynamics and the assumption about how job search takes place.
 Regarding regional dynamics, I am able to allow for shocks which are correlated
 across regions and with an aggregate component that is persistent, while
 they are assumed to be independent in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 I follow 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kennan2003effect"

\end_inset

 in assuming that individuals must visit a location in order to discover
 the exact value of their new wage, over and above a predictable part, while
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "winkler2010effect"

\end_inset

 assumes that job offers arrive in the current location from a random alternativ
e location.
 My assumption implies firstly that individuals consider all potential locations
 in each period, and decide to move based on their expectations about how
 they will fare in each.
 Secondly it allows for reasons other than job offers to trigger a move,
 which is a feature of the data, as I will show below.
 Finally, it is interesting to note that when simulating the effects of
 abolishing the mortgage interest deduction, I correct for a GE effect on
 house prices, which is likely to occur as a result of the policy change,
 and I enforce revenue neutrality by redistributing saved tax receipts,
 which is not done in his paper.
 I find that that welfare implications strongly depend on those features.

 In light of state-specific shocks to labor demand, the authors find that
 after an adverse shock, the relocation of workers is one of the main mechanisms
 to restore unemployment and participation rates back to trend in an affected
 region.

 None of them tracks movers, so it is impossible to know the circumstances
 of an individual at the moment they decided to move, which is ultimately
 of interest in this paper.

 Census Divisions are nine relatively large regions which separate the United

To a first approximation, those regions represent areas with a common housing
 and labor market.
 In the model, a move within any region is not considered as migration and
 therefore does not contribute to the overall migration rate.
 This implies that there is a proportion of moves across markets that do
 happen in the data, but which are not picked up by my geographic definition
 of a market.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aggregation of states into this particular grouping is but one of many
 possibilities, and I adopt this particular partition based on computational
 constraints.
 In many respects the ideal concept of a region is what economists would
 refer to as a local labor market, and metropolitan statistical areas (MSA)
 or commuting zones (CZ) come close to this.
 Unfortunately, for the purpose of the model in this paper, the so‚Äìdefined
 number of regions would be far too large to be computationally feasible.
 Hence the choice of census divisions.

The model presented below contains 25.4 million different points in the state
 space at which to solve a savings problem.
 Increasing the number of regions to 51 (to represent US states) increases
 this to 815 million points in the state space.
 Given that estimation requires evaluation of the model solution many times
 over, the former state space can be handled with code that is highly optimized
 for speed, while the latter cannot.

Descriptive Statistics on Cross Division Migration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I combine four panels of SIPP data (1996, 2001, 2004 and 2008) into a database
 with 102,529 individuals that I can follow over time and space.
 From this dataset, a couple of interesting facts emerge.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Annual-moving-rate"

\end_inset

 presents some summary annual moving rates for both state and Census Division
 level migration.
 The overall unconditional migration rate is 1.95% and 1.32% per year for
 cross state and cross division, respectively.
 The cross state figure differs from the 2% in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Migration-rates-Molloy"

\end_inset

 because I set up the SIPP data in terms of household heads, thereby missing
 some moves of non‚Äìreference persons, and potentially because of sample
 attrition.
 It is quite clear from table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Annual-moving-rate"

\end_inset

 that there is a marked distinction in the likelihood of moving across state
 as well as division boundaries between renters and owners, with 2.6% (1.85%)
 of renters versus 0.93% (0.7%) of owners moving across state (division) boundarie
s on average per year.
 In total I observe of 2684 cross Division moves made by 2329 unique individuals
, implying multiple moves for some movers, see table

 that there is a strongly declining age effect ‚Äì younger individuals move

Determinants of Migration.

The March Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS) contains several
 questions relevant for the study of migration.
 Here I analyse answers to the 2013 edition of the CPS to the question

\end_inset

 The results are displayed in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 It is striking to note that even though we are conditioning on moves across
 Division boundaries (and thus think of long-range moves), the percentage
 of people citing 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

housing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as their main motivation is roughly 24% of the total population of movers.
 The table also disagreggates the response to the question by the distance
 between origin and destination state (not Division), and we can see that
 the proportion of respondents does vary with distance moved, but not to
 an extent that would suggest that housing becomes irrelevant as a motivation
 with increasing distance.
 Summing up in the bottom row of the table, we see that 55% say work was
 the main reason, 24% refer to housing and the remaining 21% is split between
 family and other reasons.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:D2D-probit"

\end_inset

 I present estimates from a statistical analysis of the determinants of
 cross division moves from SIPP data.
 I regress a binary indicator for whether or not a cross division move took
 place in a given year on a set of explanatory variables which relate to
 the household in question in a probit regression.
 The table shows marginal effects computed at the sample mean of each variable,
 as well as the ratio of marginal effects to the baseline unconditional
 probability of moving (1.32%).
 The results indicate that there is a pronounced age effect, with each additiona
l year of age implying a reduction that is equal to 6% of the baseline probabili
ty.
 The same effect is found for whether or not children are present in the
 household.
 The effect of being a homeowner is very large and equivalent to a reduction
 in the propensity to move of 51% of the baseline probability.
 Increasing household income by $100,000 is equivalent to a 5% baseline
 baseline increase.
 Finally, having a college degree has an effect of equal magnitude than
 being a homeowner, but in the opposite direction: a college degree amounts
 to an increase of the baseline of 49%.
 According to this model, the effect of being a homeowner on the baseline
 moving probability is equal to an age increase of 8.3 years, thus taking
 a 30-year old to age 38; also, a household which owns the house would have
 to experience an increase in household income of $1m in order to make up
 for the implied loss in the probability of moving across divisions from
 being an owner.
 The house price to income ratio does not play a significant role in this
 specification.

\begin_layout Standard
In the model I view households as a single unit, and I'll use the terms
 
\emph on
household 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
individual
\emph default
 interchangeably.
 Individuals are assumed to live in census Division (or 
\emph on
region
\emph default
) 
\begin_inset Formula $d\in D$
\end_inset

 for a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 years of age.
 At each age 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, individual 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 has to decide whether to move to a different region, whether to own or
 rent, and how much of his labor income to save.
 Individuals derive utility from consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

, from owning a house 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 and an unobservable location preference shock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Individuals are subject to uncertainty at both the aggregate and individual
 level.
 At the aggregate level, regional house price 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and average labor productivity levels 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 fluctuate.
 This allows some scope for regional migration as an insurance mechanism.
 The regional fluctuations are driven by a common set of low dimensional
 stochastic factors denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

.
 This reflects the fact the regional shocks to both house prices and average
 labor income are highly correlated.
 It also allows for fluctuations in the underlying aggregate factors 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 to have differential impacts across regions, while maintaining a degree
 of computational tractability.
 Every individual in region 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 faces an identical level of house price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{dt}$
\end_inset

 and mean labor productivity 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{dt}$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 In addition to that, 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{dt}$
\end_inset

 enters the individual wage equation as a level shifter.
 At the individual level uncertainty enters the model through an idiosyncratic
 component of income risk, a Markovian process that models changes in household
 size over the lifecycle, and a location‚Äìspecific preference shock, which
 is assumed identically and independently distributed across agents, regions
 and time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The job search process is modeled as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kennan2003effect"

.
 Individuals do not know the exact wage they will earn in the new location.
 The new wage is composed of a deterministic, and thus predictable, part
 and a component that is random.
 Over and above an expectation about some prevailing average level of wages
 the mover can expect in any given region at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, it is impossible to be certain about the exact match quality of the new
 job ex ante.
 The new job can be viewed as an experience good where quality is revealed
 only after an initial period.
 This setup gives rise to income risk associated with moving.

 Underlying this is an assumption about non‚Äìequalizing factor prices across
 regions.
 It is plausible to think that within a single country, wages should tend
 to converge to a common level, particularly in the presence of large migratory
 flows from one region to the next.
 In assuming no relative factor price equalization across US regions I rely
 on a host of evidence showing that relative wages vary considerably across
 regions over a long time horizon (see for example

 This includes liquid savings and mortgage debt.
 There is a terminal condition for net wealth to be non-negative by the
 last period of life, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{T}+p_{dT}h_{T-1}\geq0$

, which translates into an implicit borrowing limit for owners.
 Additional to that, in order to buy, a proportion 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi p_{dt}$
\end_inset

 of the house value needs to be paid up front as a downpayment, while the
 remainder 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-\chi)p_{dt}$

Moving Costs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moving across locations is assumed to be costly in terms of utility.
 Denote 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta(d,x)$
\end_inset

 the utility costs of moving from 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 at a current value of the state vector 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 (defined below).
 Moving costs differ between renters and owners.
 Moving for an owner requires to sell the house, which in turn requires
 some effort and time costs.
 This is in addition to any other psychological costs incurred from moving
 states which are common between renters and owners.
 I specify the moving cost function as linear in parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta(d,x)=\alpha_{0,\tau}+\alpha_{1}t_{it}+\alpha_{2}t_{it}^{2}+\alpha_{3}h_{it-1}+\alpha_{4}s_{it}\label{eq:moving-cost}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

In expression 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{0,\tau}$
\end_inset

 is an intercept that varies by unobserved moving cost type 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{2}$
\end_inset

 are age effects, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{3}$
\end_inset

 measures the additional moving cost for owners, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{4}$

 measures moving cost differential arising from family size 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{it}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The unobserved moving cost type 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\in\{0,1\}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=1$
\end_inset

 indexes the high type, is a parsimonious way to account for the fact that
 in the data, some individuals never move.
 This is of particular relevance when thinking about owners, who may self‚Äìselect
 into ownership because they know they are unlikely to ever move.
 In the model this selection mechanism, together with any other factor that
 implies a high unobservable location preference, is collapsed into a type
 of person that has prohibitively high moving costs (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{0,\tau=1}$
\end_inset

 is large) and thus is unlikely to move.

 In my sample I observe less than 1% of movers for which this appears to
 be true, most likely as a result of high managment fees or a binding liquidity

 downpayment in the new region.

The consumer faces a nested optimization problem in each period.
 At the lower level, optimal savings and housing decision must be taken
 conditional on any discrete location choice, and at the upper level the
 discrete location choice with the maximal value is chosen.
 It is useful to define the conditional value function 
\begin_inset Formula $v\left(x,k\right)$
\end_inset

, which represents the optimal value after making housing and consumption
 choices at state 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

 The conditional value function

 location 
\begin_inset Formula $d$

\begin_inset Formula $d'$

 This formulation conveniently nests all discrete location choice configurations

\begin_layout Standard
Equation

\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\gamma}\approx0.577$

For individuals entering the period as owners

 Owners are not required to make a scheduled mortgage payment ‚Äì a gradual
 reduction of debt, i.e.
 an increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $a$

 Therefore the budget of the owner is only affected by the house price in
 case they decide to sell the house, i.e.

\begin_layout Standard
The budget constraint for moving owners depends on the house price in both
 current and destination regions 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 since the house in the current region must be sold by assumption.
 The expression 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-\phi)p_{dt}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:budget-own-1"

\end_inset

 relates to proceeds from sale of the house in region 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, whereas the square brackets describe expenditures in region 
\begin_inset Formula $d'$
\end_inset

.
 Notice also that the borrowing constraint 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:budget-own-borrow-1"

\end_inset

 now is a function of the value of the new house in 
\begin_inset Formula $d'$
\end_inset

.
 It is important to note that this formulation precludes moving with negative
 equity if labor income is not enough to cover it.
 This is exacerbated in cases where the mover wants to buy immediately in
 the new region, since in that case the downpayment needs to be made as
 well, i.e.
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{idt}<a_{it}+(1-\phi)p_{dt}-\chi h_{it}p_{d't}$
\end_inset

 then the budget set is empty and moving and buying is infeasible.

In my sample I observe 29 owners who move with negative equity (amounting
 to 3.4% of moving owners).
 78% of those do buy in the new location, the rest rent.
 I do not observe whether or not an owner defaults on the mortgage.
 Accounting for this subset of the population would require to 1) assume
 that they actually defaulted and 2) it would substantially increase the
 computational burden.
 For those reasons the model cannot account for this subset of the mover
 population at the moment.

Solving and Simulating the Model 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model described above is a typical application of a mixed discrete‚Äìcontinuou
s choice problem.
 In the next section I will introduce a nested fixed point estimator, which
 requires repeated evaluation of the model solution at each parameter guess,
 thus placing a binding time-contraint on time each solution may take.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The consumption/savings problem to be solved at each state, and its combination
 with multiple discrete choices and borrowing constraints, introduces several
 non-differentiabilities in the asset dimension of the value function.
 This makes using fast first order condition‚Äìbased approaches to solve the
 consumption problem more difficult.

 a robust solution (i.e.

\begin_layout Standard
I solve the model in a backward-recursive way, starting at maximal age 50
 and going back until initial age 20.
 In the final period the known final period value is computed at all relevant
 states.
 From period 
\begin_inset Formula $T-1$
\end_inset

 onwards, the algorithm in each period iterates over all state variables
 and computes a solution to the savings problem at each combination of state
 and discrete choices variables (including housing and location choices).
 After this solution is obtained at a certain state, the discrete housing
 choice is computed, after which each conditional value function 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:v"

\end_inset

 is known.
 The distributional assumption on 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 implies that the discrete location choice does not have to be computed,
 instead the main object of interest is the probability of moving function
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the solution is obtained, simulation of the model proceeds by using
 the model implied decision rules and the observed aggreate prices series
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}_{t}$
\end_inset

 as well as their regional dependants 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(q_{dt},p_{dt}\right)$
\end_inset

 to obtain simulated lifecycle data.
 As I will explain in greater detail in the next section, this proceedure
 needs to replicate the time and age structure found in the data, which
 is achieved by simulating different cohorts, starting life in 1967 and
 all successive years up until 2012.
 The model moments are then computed using the empirical age distribution
 found in the estimation sample as sampling weights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Estimation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section I explain how the model is estimated to fit some features
 of the data.
 There is a set of preset model parameters, the values of which I either
 take from other papers in the literature or I estimate them outside of
 the structural model and treat them as inputs.
 The remaining set of parameters are estimated using the simulated method
 of moments (SMM) approach, whereby given a set of parameters, the model
 is used to compute decision rules of agents, which in turn are used to
 simulate artificial data.
 A set of summarizing features from the artificial data should then be close
 to the same features of the the real data.
 I will first discuss estimation of the exogenous stochastic processes,
 and then turn to the estimation of the model preference parameters.

 Averaging over years was necessary to preserve a reasonable sample size
 in all conditioning cells.
 However, it also introduces an initial conditions and cohort effects problem,
 since, for example, a 30-year-old in 1997 faced a different economic environmen
t over their lifecycle than a similar 30-year-old in 2012 would have.
 The challenge is to construct an artificial dataset from simulated data,
 which has the same time and age structure as the sample taken from the
 data ‚Äì in particular, agents in the model should have faced the same sequence
 of aggregate shocks as their data counterparts from the estimation sample.
 This requires to simulate individuals starting in different calendar years,

 I introduce here two auxiliary models inluded in

 Both models are linear probability models, where the dependent variable
 is either ownership status at the beginning of the period,

Identification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Identification is achieved by comparing household behaviour under different
 price regimes.
 The variation comes from using the observed house price and labor productivity
 series in estimation, which vary over time and by region.
 The identifying assumption is that, conditional on all other model features,
 households must be statistically identical across those differing price
 regimes.
 In particular, this requires that household preferences be stable over
 time and do not vary by region.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The model is not non-parametrically identified; Both variation in prices
 and further restrictions such as functional form are needed, because price
 variation is at the regional (and not household-) level.

The structural parameters in 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 are related to the moment vector 
\begin_inset Formula $m(\theta)$
\end_inset

 in a highly non-linear fashion.
 In general, all moments in 
\begin_inset Formula $m(\theta)$
\end_inset

 respond to a change in 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

.
 However it is possible to use graphical analysis to show how some moments
 relate more strongly to certain parameters than others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding parameters of the moving cost function, parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{0,\tau=0},\alpha_{3},\alpha_{4}$
\end_inset

 represent the intercept for low moving cost types, the coefficent on ownership
 and the effect of household size on moving costs, respectivley.
 They are related to, in order, the average moving rate 
\begin_inset Formula $E[\text{move}]$
\end_inset

, the moving rate conditional on owning 
\begin_inset Formula $E[\text{move}|h_{t}=1]$
\end_inset

, and the moving rate conditional on household size 
\begin_inset Formula $E[\text{move}|s_{t}=1]$
\end_inset

.
 The age effects 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}$
\end_inset

 are related to the age‚Äìcoefficients of the auxiliary model for moving,
 defined in expression 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:auxmod-move"

\end_inset

, as well as the the average proportion of movers in the last period of
 life 
\begin_inset Formula $E[\text{move}|T]$
\end_inset

.
 The relationship between mobility and ownership, as well as mobility and
 household size are also captured by the covariances 
\begin_inset Formula $Cov(\text{move},h)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Cov(\text{move},s)$
\end_inset

, both of which are again related to the moving cost parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{3}$

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{4}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
The proportion of high moving cost types 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 is related to the data moments concering the number of moves per person,
 and in particular the fraction of individuals who never moved,

\end_inset

.
 The other two moments on the frequency of moves, 
\begin_inset Formula $E[\text{moved once}]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E[\text{moved twice+}]$
\end_inset

 help to identify all moving cost parameters.

\begin_layout Standard
Given that the house price processes in each region are exogenous to the
 model, the parameters measuring utility from ownership, 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{1},\xi_{2}$

 region and by household size, the covariance of owning with household size,
 and the age‚Äìprofile parameters from the auxiliary model of ownership in

\begin_layout Subsection
Parameter Estimates and Moments (Preliminary)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model fits the data moments fairly well overall.
 The fit is displayed in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:fit-model-and-data"

\end_inset

.
 The upper panel shows moments related to mobility, the lower panel shows
 moments related to homeownership.
 Regarding mobility, the fit is very good.
 The only statistic slightly out of line is the frequency distribution of
 moves per mover.
 There is no mechanism in the model that could generate the observed pattern
 in the data.
 One possibility would be to augment the set of moving cost types with a
 third type that has an even lower moving cost.
 The estimates for the auxiliary model defined in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:auxmod-move"

\end_inset

 representing the age profile in ownership also provide a good fit to the
 data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moving on to moments related to ownership, we see that the unconditional
 mean of ownership is identical to the data moment.
 Condition by region provides a more varied picture, with some regions overestim
ated and others underestimated.
 The reason for this is that there is heterogeneity in ownership rates by
 region which is not easily accounted for by the fundamentals of regional
 house price and mean income alone.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There is large degree of house price heterogeneity at the local level with
 is not in the model but which contributes to the average ownership rate
 at the regional level.
 Local building regulations, rent control or certain topographical features
 all influence the actual house price that the local level; The price index
 used in the model incurs some unavoidable aggregation error in this respect,
 and the same holds for my estimate of the average rent to price ratio.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Remember that by taking prices and incomes as given, the model is restricted
 to only few levers that affect the homeownership rate.
 The main parameters in this respect are the utility premia 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{1},\xi_{2}$
\end_inset

 and the weight in the final period utility 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

.
 The model at the moment overpredicts ownership in later periods of life.
 This is visible from the intercept of the auxiliary model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:auxmod-h"

\end_inset

, which relates the ownership rate to an age profile.
 The reason for this is that in a model where age and wealth are the main
 dimensions of variation across households, as soon as a certain wealth
 threshold is crossed, all agents become owners.
 In other words, the model cannot account for wealthy houeholds who prefer
 not to own.
 One way to improve in this dimension would be to introduce different types
 of housing preferences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that the CRRA coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is taken as fixed in the current implementation of the model, the moments
 relating to wealth resulting from the model can be viewed as some form
 of model validation.
 The model moments in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

The role of moving costs 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moving costs in the model are measured in terms of utility.
 I convert them to dollar values by finding the amount of compensating assets
 
\begin_inset Formula $a'$
\end_inset

 which would make an individual at state 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 indifferent between the value of moving with costs 
\begin_inset Formula $(v)$
\end_inset

 (but extra assets) and without 
\begin_inset Formula $(\tilde{v})$
\end_inset

.
 I consider moves from region 
\begin_inset Formula $d=2$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, moving costs are measured by 
\begin_inset Formula $a'$
\end_inset

 which solves
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
v(2,1,x+a')-\tilde{v}(2,1,x)=0.
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

There are several reasons for why owners move less than renters.
 First, they have higher moving costs as implied by a positive estimate
 for parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 Second, owners pay a transaction cost each time they sell the house (proportion
al cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

), which affects the value of migration.
 Third, owners have to comply with the downpayment constraint if they wish
 to buy in the new region, which puts restrictions on the consumption paths
 of movers.
 Finally, ownership is correlated with larger household size 
\begin_inset Formula $(s=1)$
\end_inset

, which itself carries a higher moving cost 
\begin_inset Formula $(\alpha_{4})$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Decomposing-owner's-moving"

\end_inset

 I decompose the reduced mobility of owners arising from higher utility
 costs 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{3}$
\end_inset

 and the fixed cost of selling 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

.
 Ownership increases as we successively remove frictions along the first
 row of the table, as expected.
 Perhaps more surprisingly, the second row shows that the average migration
 rate increases by roughly the same amount if we remove the owner's moving
 cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{3}$
\end_inset

 or the fixed cost of selling 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

.
 This does not mean that financial frictions are of equal importance for
 mobility than non-financial ones.
 As shown in the final two rows of the table, this result is driven by a
 change in composition, i.e.
 the aggregate migration rate is higher because we have more owners, who
 also move more.
 The final row shows that the increase in migration resulting from zero
 non-financial costs is greater than the increase from no financial transaction
 costs.

The effects on migration of a regional shock
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section I illustrate how the model reacts to large economic shocks
 at the regional level.
 The presentation focuses on changes in migratory in and outflows to and
 from a region, when the regional price or income level is reduced unexpectedly
 at a certain point in time.
 The implementation of the shock is symmetric for both the case of house
 price and mean income, and I will use the case of the regional productivity
 shock to explain the details.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The regional shock consists of reducing the level of the observed mean income
 series by 10% in the West North Central division only (West North Central
 (WNC) has region index 
\begin_inset Formula $d=8$
\end_inset

).
 The experiment is conducted under the assumption that agents did not foresee
 the shock and therefore are surprised in the year 2000 to find that the
 mapping form aggregate factors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(Q,P\right)$
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $ $
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\left(q_{8},p_{8}\right)$
\end_inset

 as defined in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:VAR-reg-determ"

\end_inset

 does not apply anymore.
 In terms of their beliefs about aggregate and regional prices, they observe
 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{2000}\times q_{8,2000},\iota_{2000}=0.9$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{8,2000}=\mathbf{a}_{8}\mathbf{F}_{2000}$
\end_inset

, as would be predicted by the model in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:VAR-reg-determ"

\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The surprise assumption is necessary to observe a causal effect of the price
 change, since otherwise the response of agents would be partially anticipating
 the shock.
 They immeditately adjust to the new mapping and behave optimally to the
 new sequence of prices in WNC, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \hat{p}_{8,t}\right\} _{t=2000}^{2012}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The shock is permanent thereafter, i.e.

 Notice that none of the time series properties of the regional price series
 other than the level are changed.
 In particular, the growth rate and implied variance remain the same.
 The other regional series (house price in this instance) is held constant
 in each experiment, as well as both series in all other regions.
 Illustrations of the shocked price and income series are shown in figures

\begin_layout Standard
Reducing mean labor productivity 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 in a given region translates directly into lower disposable income and
 therefore less utility.
 The effect of an unexpected reduction in the observed mean income level
 for WNC by 10% on migration outflows are shown in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:yshock-outflow"

\end_inset

.
 The solid lines trace out the migration flows in the baseline scenario,
 while the dashed lines correspond to the shock scenario.
 In the right panel, showing renter emigration, we see clearly that the
 income reduction leads to a sustained increase in emigrants.
 The left panel shows owner outflows, and we also see a slight increase
 in emigration owners.
 In terms of the above discussion about moving costs and preference shocks,
 both results come from the fact that smaller payoff shocks are sufficient
 to trigger a move in the shock scenario than was the case in the baseline.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the opposite flow of migration, figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:yshock-inflows"

\end_inset

 shows the corresponding pictures for immigration from the rest of the economy
 into WNC.
 Starting with owners moving to WNC in the left panel, lower mean income
 makes the region is less attractive as a destination relative to other
 regions, thus we see a slight decrease in arrivals.
 The effect is much more pronounced for renters in the right hand panel.
 It is interesting to note the shape of the solid line tracing out the baseline
 inflows: As prices in the rest of the economy start to increase towards
 the peak in 2008, WNC, with it's relatively low level of house prices becomes
 more attractive to renters.
 The increase in renter immigration towards 2005 is large, however, it needs
 to be looked at together with the corresponding ouflows at the time.
 Over the period 1998‚Äì2012, WNC experiences average annual population growth
 of 1.08% in the baseline model.

, the left panel shows that fewer owners are leaving the region than before.
 Owners experience a loss in net wealth, but this results in only small
 changes to migration behaviour.
 From the perspective of owners, the losses are sunk costs, and to the extent
 that lower current wealth makes it harder to afford a downpayment in other
 regions, the benefits of moving are reduced.
 For renters, we also see a clear reduction in ouflows.
 Given that rent in the region has fallen to lower levels than before, fewer
 renters decide to leave.
 It is interesting at this point to remember the result in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, where low skilled individuals are less likely to move away from a depressed
 region because they want to take advantage of cheap housing.
 The same mechanism operates here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Turning finally to the effects of a reduction in house prices on inflows
 to WNC, we see in both panels that lower prices attract slightly more owners,
 and significantly more renters, particularly as aggregate prices rise and
 therefore the cost of living in other regions increases disproportionately
 for renters.
 Both owners and renters move to the region to enjoy cheaper housing.

\begin_layout Subsection
The value of Migration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section I investigate the value of the migration option.
 The experiment assumes that the situation of West North Central changes
 in the sense that immigration is allowed, but emigrating is prohibited.
 First we will discuss changes in migration flows, and the ex-ante welfare
 effects for residents of WNC under both scenarios.
 Finally, we will analyze the experience of individuals who would have moved
 in the baseline environment, but are now prevented from doing so.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Migration flows and are displayed in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:value-of-migration-flows"

\end_inset

.
 The top panel shows changes in immigration flows to the region for both
 scenarios, and the respective percentage change.
 Comparing the first two columns as percentage changes in column three,
 we see that inflows into the region fall dramatically in a world where
 moving away from WNC is not an option.
 This shows that agents outside of the region perceive WNC as a much inferior
 option to the baseline.
 In the lower panel of the table I show baseline emmigration flows for compariso
n.
 The bottom row of the table gives an estimate of average lifetime utility
 across both regimes, and we see that removing the option to leave the region
 carries a very large penalty.
 Across both regimes, average expected lifetime utility falls by 5.1%, which
 implies that individuals would demand a 4.4% increase in per period consumption
 in a world without the moving option before they would be indifferent to
 the baseline.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 shows the average levels of utility conditional on age inside of WNC and
 in all other regions.
 We can see in the right panel, that reducing the value of WNC for potential
 immigrants affects utility only marginally.
 This comes from the fact that movers can easily avoid the region by moving
 somewhere else.
 For individuals inside the region, however, the changes are substantial
 and they vary by age.
 We can see that it is particularly younger individuals who suffer from
 the removed option to move.
 This makes intuitive sense, since the forgone expected gains from moving
 are larger if we consider a longer time horizon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To summarize this subsection, restricting the ability to move implies large
 losses in welfare.
 This effect stems from the inability of residents to respond to changes
 in their economic environment over time, as well as their inability to
 accomodate location preference shocks.

Abolishing the Mortgage Interest Deduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section I investigate the impact of abolishing the mortgage interest
 deduction on migration and ownership rates.
 In the United States, homeowners are allowed to deduct the interest paid
 on the mortgage for their primary residence from taxable income.
 This reduces the user cost of owning because it exempts one of the largest
 component of an owner's housing cost ‚Äì mortgage interest ‚Äì from taxation.
 This is different for renters, whose housing expenditures are not tax deductibl
e.

It is often held that if there were an offsetting taxation of imputed rent
 which owner-occupiers pay to themselves in place, the negative aspects
 of the subsidy could be greatly reduced.
 Implementing such taxes is politically difficult in most circumstances,
 probably highlighted by the small number of nations which have adopted
 some form of this tax.
 For the case of Switzerland, see

\end_layout

\end_inset

 The common wisdom is that it distorts the housing market by subsidizing
 owners, thereby leading to a higher rate of ownership as would arise without
 the subsidy.
 As discussed at length above, owners are less mobile than renters, so the
 question investigated in this subsection is whether abolishing the mortgage
 interest deduction would increase mobility, and if so, by how much.
 The answer to this question provides some guidance on whether housing policy
 could serve as an effective means to enhance the efficiency of the labor
 market by fostering greater mobility, or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point it is important to emphasize that depending on the elasticity
 of housing supply in a given market, we expect to see a general equilibrium
 effect of house prices in response to the policy change.
 The subsidy implied by the interest deduction can be viewed much like a
 characteristic of the house, like for instance distance to schools, or
 access to transportation networks.
 As such, it is capitalized into house price.
 Therefore, removing the subsidy would change long-run equilibrium prices,
 in the same way as moving a certain property to a location with a different
 set of available amenities would change its value.
 In order to partially accomodate this effect, I will refer to the recent
 paper by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "sommer2013implications"

\end_inset

, in which the authors compute the stationary general equilibrium in a model
 with infinitely lived, heterogeneous agents who are either renters, owner-occup
iers or owner-landlords.
 They compute equilibrium prices and rents arising from different assumption
 about the tax system.
 They find that house prices decrease on the order of 5% when the mortgage
 interest deduction is abolished, with rents keeping roughly constant and
 the homeownership rate increasing from 65% to 71%.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The mechanism is as follows: removing the subsidy lowers the equilibrium
 house price, since this is no longer capitalized into the value of the
 house; lower house prices makes housing affordable to more low wealth people
 who couldn't buy before, thereby increasing the ownership rate.
 Their model does not feature multiple labor or housing markets, and resting
 on the stationary equilibrium concept it does not allow for variation in
 house prices over time as is the case here; nevertheless, using their result
 to adjust the level of house prices by 5% in all locations when removing
 the mortgage deduction seems like a worthwhile exercise to at least approximate
 a potential general equilibrium effect in my model.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment is implemented as follows.
 The model being in after tax terms, it does not feature a formal tax system
 which could be changed in an experiment.
 The role of taxes and, in general, the user cost of housing is subsumed

 restriction on assets, as explained in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

.
 In reality the interest rate deduction reduces taxable income, thereby
 increasing disposable income of owners.
 Therefore, to simulate the removal of the deduction, I reduce disposable
 income of owners by an amount equivalent to their average implied tax savings.
 To do this I use data from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_layout Standard
To provide some guidance, it is useful to start with a simple calculation
 to gauge the likely effect of the policy change on migration rates under
 the assumption that the conditional choice probabilities (i.e.
 whether to move or not) in the model do not change.
 This is equivalent to saying that there is a pure composition effect, but
 no effect on behaviour.
 To simplify the example, let's assume that the baseline ownership rate
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{o}=0.63$
\end_inset

, and that the annual migration rates for owners and renters are given by
 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{o}=0.7$
\end_inset

% and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{r}=2\%$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 This would give rise to a baseline unconditional migration rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{o}m_{o}+(1-\pi_{o})m_{r}=1.81\%$
\end_inset

.
 Assuming that the conditional choice probabilities which give rise to 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{o}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{r}$
\end_inset

 do not change due to the policy change, and assume, for example, that removing
 the subsidy increases the ownership rate by 1% such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{o}'=0.64$
\end_inset

.
 In that case we would expect to see a new migration rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{o}'m_{o}+(1-\pi_{o}')m_{r}=1.68\%$
\end_inset

, implying a decrease in the migration rate of 0.013 percentage points (or
 a 35% reduction of the rate).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The choice probabilities do change after the policy is implemented.
 In fact, it is easy to show that the only case under which the relative
 moving probabilities would remain constant is the one where the relative
 lifetime utilities in each region would change by exactly the same amount.
 This is not very likely to happen.
 Remember that the value in any location is determined by the utility derived
 from owning (enters utility directly), by the level of house prices, and
 by the level of consumption.
 Given a vector of house prices and incomes in the baseline environment,
 we can determine the relative differences in utilities and the corresponding
 probabilities of moving.
 Removing the mortgage deduction affects the price vector.
 Furthermore, by redistributing tax receipts we increase disposable income
 of a set of the population that was not able to buy before ‚Äì not in their
 current region, and possibly not in another region.
 The overall effect on the migration rate will therefore be composed of
 a composition effect (shifting individuals from renter to owner status
 or vice versa), and an effect that arises from changes in behaviour, influenced
 by different price levels, different price to rent ratios, and redistribution
 of tax receipts from previous owners to the entire population.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results are listed in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Abolishing-the-mortgage"

\end_inset

, and the columns under the subheading 
\emph on
Remove Deduction 
\emph default
show the results of the experiment with and without the GE correction.
 Both cases redistribute the taxes saved by removing the deduction on a
 per capita, per period basis.
 In other words, for total tax revenue 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 individuals observed for 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 periods, each individual receives 
\begin_inset Formula $X/(TN)$
\end_inset

 additional dollars per period.
 This scheme approximates a reduction in income taxes financed by the removal
 of the mortgage deduction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the column without the GE correction, we see that ownership decreases
 by roughly 0.8%.
 This is a result of some marginal buyers being unable to satisfy the downpaymen
t without the deduction.
 The migration rate increase only marginally despite this, because the change
 in composition towards more renters is offset to some degree by harder
 access to ownership in all regions without the benefits of the deduction.
 This reduces the incentives to move for some households who would have
 bought in different regions before.
 In terms of welfare effects, agents are close to indifferent between this
 policy and the baseline.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As a metric of welfare I compute the implicit consumption tax 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 which would make agents indifferent in terms of expected lifetime utility
 between the baseline and policy regimes, as detailed in appendix

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The final column shows the results with the GE correction, which lowers
 house prices by 5% in all regions, while keeping rents at a constant level.
 Keeping rents constant is achieved by changing the price to rent ratios
 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{d}$
\end_inset

 in proportion to the reduction in prices.
 We find that ownership increases by about 1.3% as a result of lower house
 prices.
 The reverse mechanism to the previous paragraph is at work, implying that
 more people can buy, in this case despite the removal of the subsidy to
 owners.
 The change in composition towards more owners combined with access to housing
 in more regions produces a net effect on migration that is slightly positive
 at 0.115% of the baseline rate.
 The welfare implications for this experiment are larger than in the previous
 case and amount to 2.4% of per period consumption over the lifecycle.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In concluding this section, it is instructive to note the importance of
 the general equilibrium effect in this case.
 Under the assumption of constant prices, the effect of removing the deduction
 is that ownership is reduced and that migration slightly increases.
 Removing the deduction means fewer low wealth housholds can buy housing,
 which reduces welfare, and this offsets any gains made form slightly more
 migration.
 Taking the price change and the implications for the price to rent ratio
 into account, however, shows that ownership would increase.
 This would affect the migration rate only marginally, but have a significant
 impact on welfare.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main result of this paper is to show that despite average migration
 rates being low, the option value associated with the possibility to leave
 a location in a world with regional shocks to house prices and labor income
 is large.
 Removing the option to leave a certain region in the model implies an associate
d reduction in expected lifetime utility of 5.1%, or 4.4% of per period consumptio
n.
 To arrive at this result, I construct a lifecycle model which includes
 homeownership as a choice variable next to savings and location choices,
 which I then fit to SIPP data and use to make counterfactual experiments.
 Considering homeownership is motivated by the fact that well over 60% of
 the US population are owners, and the observation that owners exhibit vastly
 different migratory behaviour than renters.
 The model places particular emphasis on a close representation of the observed
 house price and income series, both of which exhibit strong correlation
 of regional shocks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a policy experiment where I remove the mortgage interest deduction for
 owners, I find that accounting for a likely general equilibrium effect
 is crucial for the resulting effects.
 Assuming that house prices would not change as a result of removing the
 deduction implies that migration rates would increase slightly, mainly
 due to a shift in composition towards more renters.
 Correcting prices with an external estimate of the likely GE effect (a
 5% reduction as reported in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "sommer2013implications"

\end_inset

) results in a different conclusion: lower prices after the removal of the
 deduction allow more people to buy, resulting in an increase of ownership.
 The net effect on migration is only marginally positive, however, since
 part of the shift in composition towards more owners is offset by changes
 in migration behaviour brought about by lower prices in all regions and
 redistribution of income to the poor.
 The welfare implications depend greatly on whether or not prices are adjusted,
 with average welfare gains 1% in the former, and of the order of 2.4% of
 period consumption in the latter case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In its current state, the model is silent with regards to location amenities.
 Dissentangling the effects of price changes on the consumer's budget constraint
 from its effects on local amenities, and therefore utility, is clearly
 important to understand migration decisions better.
 I view the current implementation as a first step in this direction, and
 more work is necessary to incorporate amenities.

 In the first experiment, moving costs are reduced to half their level,
 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}=0.5$
\end_inset

, and in the second experiment they are doubled such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{2}=2$
\end_inset

.

The results in table

\end_inset

 refer to policy 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}=0.5$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 halfing the moving cost.
 Renters average mobility jumps to 16% of the population changing locations
 per period, owners increase from 1% to 3% of movers.
 Accordingly the ownership rate drops to 42%.
 The policy is very valuable in terms of welfare, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=0.88$
\end_inset

 implying that agents in the baseline would be ready to give up 12% of period
 consumption if they were allowed to switch to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We see the opposite kind of effects if we perform the policy in the other
 direction, i.e.
 we increase the moving cost in policy 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{2}=2$
\end_inset

.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:doubleMC"

\end_inset

 shows the results of this experiment, and we see that mobility of both
 renters and owners is reduced by a factor of 10.
 The homeownership rate increases, since some individuals who were on the
 margin of buying in the baseline and did not because they anticipated the
 possibility of a move are now tipped over the balance and buy, because
 moving got very costly.
 The implied welfare equalizing consumption subsidy is 12% of period consumption.

Solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The problem is fully discretized on a grid of points, however, the savings
 decision is allowed to be continuous.
 Linear interpolation is used to evaluate the value function between grid
 points.
 To compute the conditional expectation of the future value function in
 each period, I use the method proposed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kopecky2010701"

\end_inset

 to discretize the continuous variable 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 The expectation with respect to household size is a simple matrix operation,
 using the age-dependent transition matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{s,t}$
\end_inset

.
 In order to compute the expectation with respect to the aggregate VAR(1)
 process, I define a grid for both 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 that spans all observed values in the data and compute the transition matrix
 from each combination of grid points in the current period 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{P}_{t}^{(ij)}\equiv\left(Y_{i},P_{j}\right)$
\end_inset

 to the set of all grid points in the next period 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{P}_{t+1}^{(mk)}\equiv\left(Y_{m},P_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The VAR(1) model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:VAR-process-1"

\end_inset

 implies that given 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{P}_{t}^{(ij)}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{P}_{t+1}^{(mk)}\sim N\left(A\mathbf{P}_{t}^{(ij)},\sigma_{\nu}^{2}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The transition matrix is then constructed by evaluating all grid points
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{P}^{(mk)}$
\end_inset

 in the pdf of this distribution, and by normalizing over rows.

Initial Conditions and Cohort Setup
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SIPP estimation sample runs from 1998 through 2012.
 The data moments the model is supposed to replicate are weighted averages
 over this period, where the weights are the SIPP sampling weights.
 When reconstructing an artificial sample from the model simulation, care
 must be taken to replicate the shocks experienced by each cohort in the
 data leading up to the point where they are observed.
 
\end_layout

The data is subset to the ages allowed for in the model, i.e.
 20‚Äì50.
 I compute data moments, for example the average homeownership rate in region
 
\begin_inset Formula $d$

, or the average total wealth of age group 40‚Äì45 in 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{dt}$
\end_inset

 is the number of people in 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $t$

\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{it}$

This means that for the second data moment, for example, 40 year-olds from
 1998 contributed as well as 40 year-olds from the 2012 cohort.
 Needless to say, those cohorts faced a different sequence of house price
 shocks leading up the point of observation.
 For individuals

born
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 before the first data period, i.e.
 1998, I construct regional house price and regional income series going

 Simulating individuals from the 1968 cohort for a full lifetime of J=30
 years until the reach age 50 brings them into the year 1998, where they
 form the group of 50 year-olds in that particular year.
 This sort of staggered simulation is carried out until the final cohort
 is born in 2012 at age 20.
 No simulation needs to take place for any individual alive at years after
 2012.

In a first step I estimate the marginal distributions of 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{idt}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{ikt+1}$
\end_inset

 for all movers.
 These are the cross-sectional distributions of residuals 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{it}$

\begin_inset Formula $u_{it+1}$
\end_inset

 from the regression in expression 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:copula-margins-1"

\end_inset

, which is estimated for all movers.
 The move takes place in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, such that by assumption, 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{it}$
\end_inset

 is the residual wage in origin location 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{it+1}$
\end_inset

 is the residual wage in the new location 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\ln y_{idt}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\text{college}_{it}+\delta p(\text{age}_{it})+\beta_{2}\text{numkids}_{it}+\beta_{3}\text{sex}_{it}+\beta_{4}\text{metro}_{it}+\gamma_{d}+u_{it}\label{eq:copula-margins-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\text{age})$
\end_inset

 is a third order polynomial in age, metro is an indicator for metropolitan
 status and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{d}$
\end_inset

 is a Division fixed effect.
 Then I convert the residuals into their respective rank in the empirical
 distributions of before and after move residuals.
 Denoting the standardized values by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\hat{u}_{it},\hat{u}_{it+1}\right)$
\end_inset

, the next step involves fitting the a normal copula via maximum likelihood
 to this data.
 The results are shown in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

, and they indicate a correlation between 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{u}_{it}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{u}_{it+1}$
\end_inset

 of 0.59.
 This estimate together with the marginal distibutions of 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{it}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{it+1}$
\end_inset

 are used in the structural model, where I use the current value of

\begin_inset Formula $u_{it}$
\end_inset

 for a mover together with the copula estimate
