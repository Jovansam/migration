INCOMPLETE JOB MARKET PAPER DRAFT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
In this paper I propose a lifecycle model of internal migration in the US
 which explicitly takes the decision to buy or rent a home into account.
 The aim of the paper is to deliver estimates of the elasticity of the interregi
onal mobility rate with respect to several tax instruments related to housing,
 such as the mortgage interest deduction or the capital gains tax exemption
 for the sale of primary residence housing.
 Homeowners have greater costs of relocation, resulting in a lower propensity
 to move relative to renters.
 The model features aggregate uncertainty in house prices and labor productivity
, which impacts regions differentially.
 The model fits ownership and mobility patterns over the lifecycle well.
 Using the estimated model to make counterfactual experiments, I find a
 large impact of policies targeted at housing on the regional migration
 rate.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Homeownership and mobility are negatively correlated.
 In particular in times of significant drops in house prices, the issues
 surrounding homeowners who are reluctant to leave their home behind become
 more salient both in popular and academic press.
 Migration and ownership decisions have a strong lifecycle component, in
 the sense that individuals move more while young and buy houses as they
 get older.
 I propose a lifecycle model of migration between US census divisions where
 individuals decide to become owners and where frictions in the housing
 market and high moving costs imply that they are less likely to move than
 comparable renters, over and above a generally declining propensity to
 move over their lifespan.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The annual aggregate mobility rate across census divisions is roughly 1.15%
 of the population, and it factors as 2.12% for renters and 0.67% for owners.
 These are large differences, and there are two sets of questions that wait
 to be asked in this context.
 Firstly, what are the implications of housing policies which subsidize
 homeownership for labor market mobility? For example, what is the elasticity
 of mobility with respect to the amount of mortgage interest that may be
 deducted from income tax, an important part of US housing policy? Secondly,
 what are the properties of housing and migration as insurance devices in
 this context, i.e.
 what is the net insurance value of homeownership, given that on the one
 hand owning provides insurance against rental price risk, but on the other
 seems to hinder insurance against labor market shocks, since moving becomes
 more difficult? In this paper I will attempt to provide answers to both
 sets of questions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Why do we observe owners moving less? One answer to this question is that,
 particular in times of falling house prices, owners may have a sustantial
 amount of negative equity in the home, and they may feel obliged to stay
 put until prices recover so that any mortgage debt can be paid off, or
 simply because they lack the necessary funds to afford a downpayment for
 a new home elsewhere and they have a strong preference for owning.

They feel obliged to repay rather than willing to default on the mortgage
 contract.

 for a discussion.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Another answer could be that all else equal, owners face higher costs of
 effort when moving because they have to spend time finding a suitable buyer
 and meet with agents and lawyers and so forth -- in short, things a comparable
 renter does not have to contemplate.
 A third answer could be that they move less because they chose to stay,
 cementing their resolve, so to speak, by investing in owner--occupied property
 in a given location, based on the expectation of staying in that particular
 location for a number of years.
 It seems plausible to think that ownership and migration decisions are
 made jointly, at least in part driven by a preference for some location.
 My model incorporates all of the above mentioned mechanisms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The observed time series of house prices and median incomes in the nine
 census divisions are hard to generate from within a model over the period
 of observation (1998--2012).
 For this reason, the model simulation takes the observed series as input,
 in a bid to recreate the incentives faced by individuals in the data as
 closely as possible.
 At the heart of much of the migration literature, as well as in this model,
 lies a tension between expected incomes and house prices in a potential
 destination location.
 It is important to accurately represent the house price and income processes
 from the data inside the model in order to replicate the relative desireability
 of each region.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the model there is a simple mechanism that endogenously selects individuals
 into either renter or owner--occupied sector.
 Faced with idiosyncratic persistent uncertainty regarding their labor income,
 as well as a fluctuating house price, only individuals who satisfy a standard
 downpayment requirement are eligible to buy a house.
 Given that income increases on average over the lifecycle and depending
 on the path their individual income shocks have taken, it will in general
 take several years of assets accumulation before this constraint is satisfied.
 Not all individuals will buy a house once the constraint is satisfied,
 however, since this decision interacts with an unobserved moving cost type,
 where a high cost is supposed to capture a strong preference for the current
 location.
 Buying has implications for future mobility, as we remarked previously,
 therefore people with a higher moving cost will be more likely to end up
 buying.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I estimate the preference parameters of the model using simulated method
 of moments inside a parallel MCMC algorithm.
 I then use the estimated model to simulate the effect of gradually decreasing
 the mortgage interest rate deduction.
 I find that mobility rates strongly respond to this change, however, this
 is still work in progress so I cannot give an elasticity estimate at this
 point.

Literature.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several relevant strands of literature related to this paper.
 Most closely related is a field of research embodied by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kennan2003effect"

\end_inset

, which is a partial equilibrium model of the determinants of individual
 migration decisions across US states in a dynamic context, with a particular
 focus on the importance of return migration.
 Their main result is that in their model, income prospects in other states
 are an important determinant of individual migration decisions.
 Using a similar setup, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gemici2007family"

\end_inset

 considers the joint location problem of couples where both partners are
 participating in the labor force.
 Casting the problem as an intra-household bargaining game over the lifecycle,
 she finds that family ties significantly hinder migration decisions and
 wage growth.
 Following in this tradition of models, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gregory2013impact"

\end_inset

 analyzes the impact of a home-rebuilding grant extended to victims of the
 Katrina hurricane in New Orleans in a dynamic discrete choice model.
 My paper contributes to this literature by extending 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kennan2003effect"

\end_inset

 with a time-varying regional income and house price process, while at the
 same time including assets and housing status as a state variable.
 The combination of a lifecycle housing and savings problem in multiple
 locations with different (expectations about) price processes poses the
 main challenge in this extension.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A different and well--established literature on migration and local labor
 markets is based on the spatial equilibrium concept going back to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Roback:1982uq"

\end_inset

.
 In an authoritative handbook chapter, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Moretti:2011fk"

\end_inset

 provides an overview over much of this literature.
 As an example for a recent application, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Diamond:2012fk"

\end_inset

 analyses the welfare implications of geographic skill sorting in the US,
 whereby college graduates increasingly locate in high wage, high rent cities.
 This obfuscates any welfare comparisons, since high and low skilled pay
 different rents and consume different amenities, and she finds taking skill
 sorting into account substantially increases the welfare differential.
 I take from this literature the basic idea that welfare in any given location,
 and thus the decision to migrate to it, depends among other things on the
 tension between wages and rents in that location.
 At difference to this framework my model is dynamic, so it can capture
 the human capital investment aspect of migration, while having to relax
 the general equilibrium structure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The paper is also related to the public finance literature, in particular
 to the tax treatment of housing in general and ownership in particular.
 Economists have long had good reasons to be critical of the US housing
 tax code

 in a recent paper encourages to rethink what he terms

the federal housing bias

.
 He argues that public policy which encourages ownership through subsidy
 or building restrictions moves people away from dense, urban neighborhoods
 with predominatly rental accomodation and into suburban areas with owner
 occupied housing and long associated commutes.
 This is a distortion of a market where the need for public intervention
 is not obvious even after close scrutiny, and it affects inner city economic
 development and has large environmental consequences, reenforcing the need
 for policy change in the view of Glaeser.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 is a paper which fed into this conclusion, analysing the benefits of the
 home mortgage interest deduction.
 In it, the authors use a measure of the tax benefit to owners arising from
 the mortgage interest rate deduction similar to the one used in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Poterba:2008fk"

\end_inset

.
 They find that based on this measure, it seems there is no impact of the
 amount of the deduction on the aggregate homeownership rate in time series
 data, but only on the amount of housing consumed.
 As pointed out in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Poterba:2008fk"

\end_inset

, it is indeed the case that the amount of tax savings is increasing in
 household income, as higher income households are more likely to itemize
 their tax return, which is a precondition for applying for the deduction;
 However, the average tax savings for a households are still significant
 in all age and income brackets, as evident in panel B of table 1 therein.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a series of papers starting with 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "oswald1996conjecture"

\end_inset

 and leading up to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "blanchflower2013does"

\end_inset

, the authors advance the theory that homeownership is an impediment to
 labor market mobility.
 Initially based on cross-country regressions and later on state--level
 cross sectional data for the US, they find a statistical relationship between
 current unemployment and past homeownership at a lag of up to five years.
 As poptential mechanisms they cite negative externalities of homeownership
 on the wider labor market, in particular greater NIMBYism (Not In My Back
 Yard) reducing business creation and productive investments and lower attractio
n of no migrants, who may be important for economic growth but demand rental
 accomodation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Providing a more structural approach to the link between homeownership and
 unemployment, there is a growing literature analyzing if and how the recent
 house price crash has affected the reallocation of workers across locations,
 or if it affected the unemployment rate.
 The mechanisms are a variant of negative equity lock-in and search frictions
 in housing and labor markets.
 An incomplete list of contributions includes

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 At difference to those papers which focus on the equilibrium properties
 of housing and unemployment, here I spend a lot of effort in trying to
 model the budget constraint and instutional environment of a consumer as
 accurately as possible.
 In particular, age seems to be of first order importance in both housing
 and migration decisions in the data, which brings with it the need to consider
 a finite time horizon, implying that any mortgage taken out must be paid
 back at some point -- which is not implied by the previous set of papers.
 Furthermore, and as mentioned previously, it seems that the dynamics of
 house prices over the recent couple of decades are hard to reconcile with
 those models, which is particularly worrying if the exercise is to deliver
 estimates of structural parameters, as is the aim here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The contribution of this paper is to provide a link between models of housing
 demand over the lifecycle, as for example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Attanasio20121"

\end_inset

, with the literature on dynamic migration following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kennan2003effect"

\end_inset

.
 I find that housing is an important feature of the individual migration
 decision.
 The likelihood of any given move depends not only on whether or not the
 individual owns their house, but also on the price and income levels in
 all potential destination regions, and the current level of mortgage debt.
 To my knowledge this is the first empirical lifecycle model which takes
 the observed house price as given and models actual geographic location.

Empirical Background

\begin_layout Standard
Despite a recent declining trend, the amount of regional migration in the
 US is still relatively high by international standards.
 According to

\end_inset

, who use three publicly available datasets (American Community Survey (ACS),
 the Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the CPS (March CPS), and Internal
 Revenue Service (IRS) data), each year roughly 1.5% of the entire population
 moves between two out of four census regions, and about 1.3% move between
 states within any one region.
 At a more local level, they find that 5% of the population move between
 counties each year, which amounts to roughly one-third of the annual flows
 into and out of employment according to the measure in

 None of them tracks movers, so it is impossible to know the circumstances

 of interest in this paper.

It is possible to construct a panel dataset from the CPS, but only with

 If an individual moves out, this can be inferred from the data, however,
 the destination of the move cannot -- in particular it is unknown whether
 they relocated withing the city, or somewhere else.

The aggregation of states into this particular grouping is only one of many
 possibilities, and I adopted this particular partition by assuming that
 states which are geographically close to be also close in some economic
 sense.
 In many respects the ideal concept of a region is what economists would
 refer to as a local labor market, and metropolitan statistical areas (MSA)
 or commuting zones (CZ) come close to this.
 Alas, for the purpose of the model in this paper, the so defined number
 of regions would be far too large to be computationally feasible.
 Hence the choice of census divisions.

I combine four panels of SIPP data (1996, 2001, 2004 and 2008) into a large

 From this dataset, a couple of interesting facts emerge.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Annual-moving-rate"

 presents some summary annual moving rates for both state and Census Division
 level migration.
 The overall unconditional migration rate is 1.64% and 1.15% per year for
 cross state and cross division, respectively.
 The cross state figure differs from the 2% in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Migration-rates-Molloy"

\end_inset

 most likely because I set up the SIPP data in terms of household heads,
 thereby missing some moves of non--reference persons, and potentially because
 of sample attrition.
 It is quite clear form table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Annual-moving-rate"

\end_inset

 that there is a marked distinction in the likelihood of moving across state
 as well as division boundaries between renters and owners, with 3.07% (2.12%)
 of renters versus 0.94% (0.67%) of owners moving across state (division)
 boundaries on average per year.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moving on to migration by age, we can see in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:SIPP-sample-proportion-1"

\end_inset

 that firstly, renters are more likely to move at all ages, and secondly
 that there is a strong and declining age effect -- younger individuals
 move more.
 Both of those are highly salient features of the data, and they are the
 main dimension along which my model's performance is going to be evaluated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Survey evidence from the CPS suggests that among the main motivations for
 a move across division borders are work reasons (50% of respondents), reasons
 relating thou housing (25%), family--related reasons (22%) and an unclassified
 rest (3.7%).

 It is true that survey data where respondents are required to pick one
 single option have their problems, however, it also seems clear that housing
 issues are on individuals minds when making migration decisions.
 This is one motivation for writing this paper.

 I present estimates from a statistical analysis of the determinants of
 cross division moves from SIPP data.
 I regress a binary indicator for whether or not a cross division move took
 place in a given year on a set of explanatory variables which relate to
 the household in question in a probit regression.
 The table shows marginal effects computed at the sample mean of each variable,
 and the results indicate that even after controlling for a host of variables
 such as college education, presence of children in the household, total
 household wealth, household income and age, the effect of being a homeowner
 is the largest effect we measure.
 Furthermore, and as a cautionary note to the empirical researcher, the
 effects I find are very small, which has to do with the fact that the dependent
 variable is a low probability event (
\begin_inset Formula $\approx$
\end_inset

 1% of the population), and that the data we have at our disposal are insufficie
nt to draw convincing conclusions from it.
 It seems there are several unobserved variables, like job offers, shocks
 to the current job, family reasons (e.g.
 sickness of family member), etc, all of which enter the error term of the
 probit equation as random events to the econometrician.
 In the structural model I go some way to account for several sources of
 this randomness explicitly.

\begin_layout Section
Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the model I view households as unitary units, and I'll use the terms
 
\emph on
household 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
individual
\emph default
 interchangeably in what follows.
 Individuals are assumed to live in one of 
\begin_inset Formula $D$
\end_inset

 census divisions (
\emph on
regions
\emph default
)
\emph on
 
\emph default
and for a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $J$
\end_inset

 years of age.
 I use index 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 to indicate time varying variables, such as regional price and income,
 even though from the individual's perspective age 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 and prevailing prices at that age is all that matters.
 Thus at each age 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, individuals have to decide whether to move to a different region, whether
 to own or rent, and how much of their labor income to save.
 They derive utility from consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

, from owning a house 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 and from an unobserved preference for local amenities 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Individuals are subject to uncertainty at both the aggregate and individual
 level.
 Aggregate uncertainty comes in the form of shocks to the national house
 price and labor income indices 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

, which in turn affect the price and income levels in any given region in
 a deterministic kind of way.
 Region level income and prices are denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{y}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{y}$
\end_inset

 affects individual labor income, and 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 affects their balance sheet and or their choice set (for example, if prices
 are high, buying is not an option for certain individuals).
 Individual--specific uncertainty enters the model through an idiosyncratic
 component of income risk, through a markovian process that models changes
 of household size over the lifecycle, and finally a location--specific
 preference shock, which is assumed identically and independently distributed
 across agents and time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The job search process is modeled as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kennan2003effect"

\end_inset

 in the sense that individuals do not know the exact wage they will earn
 in the new location.
 The wage is composed of a deterministic, and thus predictable, part and
 a component that is random.
 The assumption is that over and above an expectation about some prevailing
 average level of wages the mover can expect in any given region, the actual
 job obtained after a move is an experience good and that it is impossible
 to be certain about the exact match quality ex ante.
 This setup gives rise to income risk associated with moving.

\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this setup I interpret 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{y}_{dt}+f(j,d)$
\end_inset

 as the price of human capital in a labor market that is segmented by age
 and where wages vary with local economic conditions.
 Underlying this structure is an assumption about non--equalizing factor
 prices across regions.
 It is plausible to think that within a single country, wages should tend
 to converge to a common level, particularly in the presence of large migratory
 flows from one region to the next.
 In assuming no relative factor price equality across US regions I rely
 on a host of evidence showing that relative wages vary considerably across
 regions over a long time horizon (see for example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "redding"

\end_inset

).
 I will refer to 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{y}_{dt}$
\end_inset

 as 
\emph on
mean wages
\emph default
 and they are allowed to vary over time and in a fashion that is outlined
 in greater detail below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With regards to variation in wages with age, I assume that human capital
 at different ages is competing in age--segmented markets and therefore
 commands a different price at each age.
 Finally, 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{idt}$
\end_inset

 should be interpreted as as a time-varying workplace match effect between
 the individual and their current occupation in region 
\begin_inset Formula $d$

 and the variance of innovations to this process, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{d}^{2}$

 across different regions, which may lead to differential compositions of

 Agents in the model have rational expectations which coincide with this
 model of aggregate price dynamics, i.e.
 when forecasting next period's aggregate state, they use the linear predictor
 implied by model

\begin_layout Subsection
Mapping aggregate prices to regional prices
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I assume that there is a deterministic mapping from the aggregate state
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{P}_{t}$
\end_inset

 into the price and income level of any region 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 which is known by all agents in the model.
 This means that once the aggregate state is known, agents know the price
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{dt}$
\end_inset

 and income level 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{y}_{dt}$
\end_inset

 in each region with certainty.
 The mapping is defined in terms of a simple linear function that depends
 on both aggregate states 
\begin_inset Formula $Y,P$
\end_inset

 and where the slope coefficients are region dependent, as shown in expression
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:VAR-reg-determ"

\end_inset

.
 Similarly to the aggregate case, 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{d}$
\end_inset

 is a matrix of coefficients specific to region 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Notice that the great virtue of this formulation is that the relevant price
 and income related state variables in each region are subsumed in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{P}_{t}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $a_{d}$

Home Ownership Choice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ownership choice is discrete, 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{t}\in\left\{ 0,1\right\} $
\end_inset

, and there is no quantity choice of housing.
 While renting, i.e.
 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{t}=0$
\end_inset

, individuals must pay rent which amounts to a constant fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{d}$
\end_inset

 of the current region-
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 house price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{d}$
\end_inset

.
 In order to buy, a proportion 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi p_{dt}$
\end_inset

 of the house value needs to be paid up front as a downpayment, while the
 remainder 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-\chi)p_{dt}$
\end_inset

 is financed by a standard fixed rate mortgage.
 In other words, only owners are allowed to borrow with their house as a
 collateral, and there is no unsecured debt.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to the setup in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Attanasio20121"

\end_inset

, I denote nonhousing wealth at age 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

assets
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

 and assume as a terminal condition that net wealth be non-negative by the
 last period of life in the model, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{J}+p_{dJ}h_{J}\geq0$
\end_inset

, which translates into an implicit borrowing limit for owners.
 This implies that owners will choose a savings path contingent on the current
 price, their debt level, and their current age 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 such that they can satisfy this constraint in the final period.
 Furthermore, this setup does not require the owner to fulfil the downpayment
 (or margin) constraint in every period, but only in the period of purchase.
 This implies that when prices fall, owners do not have to adjust the size
 of their mortgage by remortgaging or selling the home, as long as the make
 the required interest payment.

Moving Costs.

\begin_layout Standard
Moving across locations is assumed to be costly in terms of utility.
 Denote

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $d$

 to

\begin_inset Formula $x$

 (defined below).
 Moving costs differ between renters and owners.
 Moving for an owner requires to sell the house, which in turn requires
 some effort and time costs.
 This is on top of any other psychological costs incurred from moving states
 which are common between renters and owners.
 I specify the moving cost function as linear in parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta(d,k,x)=\alpha_{0,\tau}+\alpha_{1}p_{it}h_{it}+\alpha_{2}\delta(d,k)+\alpha_{3}j_{it}+\alpha_{4}s_{it}\label{eq:moving-cost}

Restrictions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moving is subject to a restriction regarding housing choices.
 I rule out the possibility of owning a home in region 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 while residing in region 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 This would apply for example for households who keep their home in 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, rent it out on the rental market, and purchase housing services either
 in rental or owner--occupied sector in the new region 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 I rule out this possibility because I observe very few movers in my sample
 doing this, presumably deterred by high management costs for letting agents
 and because of liquidity constraints, i.e.
 they need the money to buy a new place in the new region 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 I illustrate this in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 their current home right after a move.

 I make the standard assumption of additive separability between utility
 and idiosyncratic location shock 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 as well as the conditional independence assumption that says that the transitio
n of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$

 is independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, I assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon\sim$

 EV Type 1.

The laws of motion for

\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}

s'|s_{j} & \sim & \Gamma_{s,j}\\
\mathbf{P}'|\mathbf{P} & \sim & \Gamma_{\mathbf{P}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

In what follows I will use the expectations operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{E}_{z',s',\mathbf{P}'}\left[V|z,s,\mathbf{P}\right]$
\end_inset

 to abbreviate the implied tensor product multiplication used in obtaining
 the expected future value function.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is useful to define the conditional value function 
\begin_inset Formula $v\left(x,k\right)$

 Notice that the value from each discrete choice is additively seperable

\begin_inset Formula $v$

\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$

 The conditional value function 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 represents the choices that have to be made conditional on being in a given

\begin_inset Formula $d$

 This formulation conveniently nests all discrete location choice configurations

\end_inset

 and moving from 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $k,\forall k\neq d$

 This expression shows the maximization problem faced by the consumer conditiona
l on choosing region

 outlined just below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equation

 is a result of the distributional assumption on 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$

 whereby 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\gamma}$

 is Euler's constant.

\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

A convient by-product of the Type 1 EV assumption is that there is a closed
 form expression for the conditional choice probability of making a move
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $k$

Renters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The period budget constraint for renters (i.e.
 individuals who enter the period with 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{it-1}=0$
\end_inset

) depends on their housing choice, as shown in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 In case they buy at date 
\begin_inset Formula $t$

\begin_inset Formula $p_{dt}$

 Labor income is defined in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $\overline{y}_{dt}$
\end_inset

 as introduced in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 Buyers can borrow against the value of their house and are required to
 make a proportional downpayment amounting to a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 of the value at purchase, while renters cannot borrow at all.
 This is embedded in constraint 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

, which states that if a renter chooses to buy, their next period assets
 must be greater or equal to the fraction of the purchase price that was
 financed via the mortgage, or non-negative otherwise.
 Constraint number 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

 of which are taken as exogenous parameters in the model.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Owners.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For individuals entering the period as owners 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(h_{it-1}=1\right)$
\end_inset

, the budget constraint is similar except for two differences which relate
 to the borrowing constraint and transfers in case they sell the house.
 Owners are not required to make a scheduled mortgage payment -- a gradual
 reduction of debt, i.e.
 an increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, arises naturally from the terminal condition 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{iJ}+p_{J}h_{iJ-1}>0$
\end_inset

, as mentioned above.
 Therefore the budget of the owner is only affected by the house price in
 case they decide to sell the house, i.e.
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{it}=0$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, they obtain the purchase price net of the proportional selling
 cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

, plus they have to pay rent in 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, which is as already mentioned a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{d}$
\end_inset

 of the prevailing house price.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of the borrowing constraint, I don't require the owner to comply
 with the downpayment constraint 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:budget-rent-downpay"

\end_inset

 in every period, as this would imply that a reduction in house price requires
 the owner to reduce the size of their mortgage, similarly to an investor
 who receives a margin call.
 Imposing this constraint in every period substantially decreases the amount
 of insurance against house price fluctuations provided by ownership and
 to which renters are exposed, thereby shutting down one important motivation
 to own in the model (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "sinai2005owner"

\end_inset

).
 Instead, owners are allowed to only make the interest payment on the mortgage,
 thus keep the balance constant, or borrow up to proportion 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-\chi)$
\end_inset

 of the current price as a buyer would, whichever amount is smaller (i.e.
 less positive).

\end_inset

Owners.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The budget constraint for moving owners depends on the house price in both
 current and destination regions 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 since the house in the current region must be sold by assumption.
 The expression 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-\phi)p_{dt}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:budget-own-1"

\end_inset

 relates to proceeds from sale of the house in region 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, whereas the square brackets describe expenditures in region 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 Notice also that the borrowing constraint 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:budget-own-borrow-1"

\end_inset

 now is a function of the value of the new house in 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 It is important to note that this formulation precludes moving with negative
 equity if labor income is not enough to cover it.
 This is exacerbated in cases where the mover wants to buy immediately,
 since in that case the downpayment needs to be made as well, i.e.
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{idt}<a_{it}+(1-\phi)p_{dt}-\chi h_{it}p_{kt}$
\end_inset

 then the budget set is empty and the move is infeasible.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In my sample I observe 29 owners who move with negative equity (amounting
 to 3.4% of moving owners).
 78% of those do buy in the new location, the rest rent.
 I do not observe whether or not an owner defaults on the mortgage, which
 may be the action taken by this group of movers.
 Accounting for this subset of the population would require to 1) assume
 that they actually defaulted and 2) it substantially increase the computational
 burden.
 For those reasons the model cannot account for this subset of the mover
 population at the moment.

Estimation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section I explain how the model is calibrated and estimated to fit
 some features of the data.
 There is a set of preset model parameters, the values of which I either
 take from other papers in the literature or I estimate them outside of
 the structural model and treat them as inputs.
 They are listed in table x.
 The remaining set of parameters are estimated using the simulated method
 of moments (SMM) approach, whereby given a set of parameters, the model
 is used to compute decision rules of agents, which in turn are used to
 simulate artificial data that should be close in some sense to the real
 data.
 The set of parameters to be estimated by SMM is 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=\left\{ \alpha_{0,\tau},\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},\alpha_{3},\alpha_{4},\gamma,\omega,\pi_{\tau},\xi(0),\xi(1)\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The objective function is the squared distance between the model moments
 and the corresponding data moments, each weighted by the variance in the
 data.
 In other words, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

 is the vector of variances of data moments, the weighting matrix of the
 SMM estimator is 
\begin_inset Formula $I\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

To provide some evidence for the particular parametric form of the evolution
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 when moving across regions, it is useful to view 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{idt}$
\end_inset

 in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:income-process"

\end_inset

 as the residual from an ordinary least squares regression of log wages
 on time and region effects, as well as person specific demographic predictors.
 The question is whether individuals with a particularly high residual 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{idt}$
\end_inset

 are likely to have a high residual 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{ikt+1}$
\end_inset

 after their move to region 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, we want to investigate the joint distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(z_{idt},z_{ikt+1}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 In a first step I estimate the marginal distributions, which is just the
 cross-sectional distribution of both margins.
 Unsurprisingly, both margins are close to normal, which indicates a well-specif
ied regression model.
 The next step involves fitting the copula 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 via maximum likelihood to those data.
 The results indicate that there is a relatively high degree of dependence
 in the residual, with the estimated copula parameter of the order of 0.7.
 This estimate is in line with a simple correlation measure between 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{idt}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{ikt+1}$

I use an adapted version of the MCMC algorithm as devised by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "baragatti2013likelihood"

\end_inset

.
 In essence, this is a likelihood free estimator which employs what is called
 parallel tempering, i.e.
 several Monte Carlo chains that evolve in parallel and at different 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

temperatures
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 with different variances of the shock used to generate new parameter guesses).
 The key is that the chains are allowed to communicate at random times,
 such that if for example a hot (high variance) chain explored and area
 of the parameter space with relatively small function evaluations, cooler
 chains can jump to that region.
 This is an advantage in problems with multiple local optima and non-differentia
bilities, such as the one at hand.
 Furthermore, the parallel setup of the estimator lends itself almost naturally
 to large computer clusters, where each compute node is a chain.

Initial Conditions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SIPP estimation sample runs from 1998 through 2012.
 The data moments the model is supposed to replicate are weighted averages
 over this period, where the weights are the SIPP sampling weights.
 When reconstructing an artificial sample from the model simulation, care
 must be taken to replicate the shocks experienced by each cohort in the
 data leading up to the point where they are observed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data is subset to the ages allowed for in the model, i.e.
 20--50.
 I compute data moments, for example the average homeownership rate in region
 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, or the average total wealth of age group 40--45 in 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, as averages over the entire sample period:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{mean\_own\_data}_{d} & = & \frac{1}{15}\sum_{t=1998}^{2012}\left(\frac{1}{N_{dt}}\sum_{i\in d,t}^{N_{dt}}\omega_{it}\mathbf{1}\left[h_{it}=1\right]\right)\\
\text{mean\_wealth\_data\_40\_45}_{d} & = & \frac{1}{15}\sum_{t=1998}^{2012}\left(\frac{1}{N_{dt,j\in[40,45]}}\sum_{i\in d,t,j\in[40,45]}^{N_{dt,j\in[40,45]}}\omega_{it}w_{ijt}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{dt}$
\end_inset

 is the number of people in 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 at date 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{it}$
\end_inset

 is a person's crossectional weight, and 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in d,t$
\end_inset

 stands for 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is in 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 at date 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in d,t,j\in[40,45]$
\end_inset

 stands for 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is in 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 at date 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and age 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This means that for the second data moment, for example, 40 year-olds from
 1998 contributed as well as 40 year-olds from the 2012 cohort.
 Needless to say, those cohorts faced a different sequence of house price
 shocks leading up the point of observation.
 For individuals 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

born
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 before the first data period, i.e.
 1998, I use the PSID to compute a long running series for the median national
 house value, starting in 1968, which is the first year of available data.

 Simulating individuals from the 1968 cohort for a full lifetime of J=30
 years until the reach age 50 brings them into the year 1998, where they
 form the group of 50 year-olds in that particular year.
 This sort of staggered simulation is carried out until the final cohort
 is born in 2012 at age 20.
 No simulation needs to take place for any individual alive at years after
 2012.

.
 I target only a subset of the moments in this table - basically don't target
 all wealth moments.
 TODO make separate table for targeted and non moments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Starting from the top of the table, the fit to average moving rates is overall
 reasonable.
 The average moving rates conditional on having children or on being an
 owner are in line with the shares observed in the data, as are the covariances
 of moving with owning and moving with children.
 Next in line are coefficients from a linear regression model (prefixed
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

lm
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

), relating cross division moves to a quadratic age term.
 The fit on the age coefficients is good.

 relate to the fraction of the population that moved zero, one or two and
 more times respectively.
 The model overpredicts the proportion who never move at the current preliminary
 parameter vector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Next in line are the average homeownership rates by Census Division.
 The model is having a hard time fitting the different homeownership purely
 based on the observed aggregate price to income ratios and two preference
 parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi$
\end_inset

.
 There is a good reason for this.
 While in the model a higher price to income ratio means that fewer people
 can afford to buy a house, thus ownership decreases, in the data we see
 the reverse relationship from 1998 to 2012.
 This is investigated in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Determinants-of-ownership"

\end_inset

, where I regress the housing status indicator variable of individual 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 on region dummies, age and income, but most importantly the price to income
 ratio in both datasets from simulation and SIPP.
 As is clear from the left panel of the table, which shows the model data,
 the price to income ratio operates through a very simple channel: the higher
 the ratio, the lower the probability of owning, by the purely mechanical
 effect of the downpayment constraint.
 Contrast this with the coefficient of the price to income ratio in the
 right column, which is positive.
 This means that, for the period considered, a higher price to income ratio
 means higher ownership.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
To make this comparison I use the region level median income to compute
 the price to income ratio, equivalently to what I do in the simulation
 data.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 For example, decreasing lending standards and large scale securitization
 over the concerned period could have the extended credit to ever more buyers
 for ever higher prices during this period.
 In summary, replicating this phenomenon is out of reach for this model,
 which is the main reason that those moments are off target.
 For a graphical illustration of this, consider figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:fit-ownership-division"

\end_inset

, in particular the path observed in region Pacific (Pcf).
 As prices rise towards the peak in 2007, the model ownership rate goes
 down, whereas the data ownership rate stays constant and even increases
 before decreasing in 2007.
