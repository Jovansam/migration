\begin_layout Abstract
This paper estimates a lifecycle model of consumption, housing choice and
 migration in the presence of aggregate and regional shocks, using the Survey
 of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).
 Using the model I estimate the value of the migration option.
 The value of the option to move ranges from 0% up to almost 13% of lifetime
 consumption depending on the type of household considered.
 Individuals self-select into ownership, and the model provides cross equation
 restrictions to address this problem.
 In doing so, it identifies several structural primitives like for instance
 separate moving cost functions for renters and owners, which are of first
 order importance for policy makers concerned with housing and labor markets.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Households are subject to many types of shocks, such as aggregate shocks,
 regional shocks and idiosyncratic shocks.
 As the recent crisis painfully reminds us, regional shocks to wages and
 house prices can be deep and prolonged.
 This paper develops and estimates a structural model with aggre- gate and
 regional shocks to wages and house prices in a life-cycle setting, in which
 households can insure against these shocks by migrating to another region,
 saving, and buying or renting a house.
 The model is estimated to match key moments from the Survey of Income and
 Program Participation (SIPP) related to mobility and homeownership across
 regions and by age.
 This framework helps evaluate the costs of regional shocks and the benefits
 of the various channels of self-insurance, thus also helps to inform policy
 reforms that affect the costs of these self-insurance mechanisms, including
 changing the costs of owning a house and moving.
 The estimated model implies that, while yearly mobility flows across regions
 are small, mobility is a very valuable option.
 In fact, were we to prevent the residents of a certain region from moving
 away, their expected lifetime utility falls by 5.1% and they would demand
 a 4.4% increase in period consumption for compensation.
 The model also finds that, were the mortgage interest-rate deduction eliminated
, the aggregate migration rate would increase only marginally by 0.1%.
 Using a general equilibrium correction, house prices are reduced by 5%,
 which results in a 1% increase in ownership.
 Redistribution of tax receipts towards poorer households and lower prices
 everywhere increase the incentives to exploit regional differences, which
 changes migration behaviour.
 Individuals value the elimination of the deduction by 2.4% of period consumption.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regional migration rates in the USA are relatively low despite the presence
 of large regional shocks.
 However, it would be a mistake to conclude from this observation that the
 option to migrate across regions has a small value to consumers.
 The goal of this paper is to provide a measure of having the option to
 migrate in the context of a lifecycle model with regional income and house
 price uncertainty, and I show that the value is large.
 To arrive at this measure, after fitting the model to micro data, I perform
 a counterfactual experiment whereby all migration between regions is shut
 down.
 I then ask the question of how large of a compensation affected inviduals
 would demand in order to be indifferent between implementation and not
 of this policy.
 I can show that considering homeowners and renters separately in the model
 is of first order importance for answering this question, since they have
 very different elasticities of migration with respect to regional shocks.
 Providing structural estimates of crucial objects like moving costs by
 ownership status is important for many realms of public policy, and hence
 another contribution of the paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regional shocks to labor demand and house prices may have profound and longlasti
ng impacts, as we have seen in the aftermath of the 2007 fall in house prices
 and ensuing Great Recession.
 In this episode we have seen wide variation in the magnitude of local shocks
 despite underlying high national correlations.
 For example, the peak-to-trough decline in the Federal Housing Financing
 Agency (FHFA) house price index from 2007 to 2011 ranged from -2.2% in the
 West South Central Census Division, to -42% in the Pacific Division.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shocks to regional labor demand affect renters and owners in a similar way,
 i.e.
 labor income of both falls.
 The effect of a fall in house prices is more nuanced, since renters stand
 to benefit from cheaper rent, if this is related to prices, and they may
 be able to purchase a now cheaper house, while owners may lose wealth invested
 in the house.
 For those reasons, we should expect to see different reactions in the mobility
 of renters and owners in response to different shocks.
 Labor market shocks should make both types more likely to leave the region,
 while price shocks could have differential impacts, depending on the relative
 importance of cheap rents, low value housing asset, and moving costs for
 renters and owners.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 2013, 63% of occupied housing units in the US were owned, while 37% were
 rented.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
see American Community Survey 2013, table DP04.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 At the same time, roughly 1.3% of the population migrate across US census
 division boundaries per year.
 Conditioning on ownership we find that 1.9% of renters and 0.67% owners move.
 A natural question is then to ask why do we observe owners moving less?
 All else equal, owners face higher moving costs, both in terms of financial
 as well as time and effort costs.
 Financial costs occur because of transaction costs in the housing market
 upon sale of the house (e.g.
 agency fees or transaction taxes), while costs of effort arise from owners
 having to spend time finding a suitable buyer, meet with agents and lawyers
 etc.
 A comparable renter is subject to those costs only to a lesser degree.
 Buying a house means to make a highly local financial investment, which
 is subject to shocks as discussed above, is relatively illiquid, and in
 addition may have a location specific flow of utility.
 Consumers may have preferences for locations.
 Finally, there is selection into homeownership based on unobservable moving
 costs: Individuals with a particular distaste for moving will be more likely
 to select into homeownership, because they anticipate that they are unlikely
 to ever move in the future.
 All of these factors interact to shape the joint decision of housing tenure,
 location choice, and mortgage borrowing.
 What is more, they all interact to influence the decision to move in response
 to a shock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the model I develop, there are several mechanisms which affect the home
 ownership choice of individuals.
 A downpayment requirement means that only individuals with sufficient cash
 on hand are able to buy a house at the current price.
 The model assumes a preference for owner-occupied accomodation, a local
 amenity and a partially unobserved cost of moving, which influence the
 buying decision in addition to age, the probability of moving, and beliefs
 about future shocks.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of the decision to migrate to another region, the model predicts
 that the likelihood of migration is increasing in the difference of discounted
 expected lifetime utilities between any two regions.
 Those relative utilities, in turn, depend among other things on the average
 regional income level and the level of regional house prices, both of which
 vary over time.
 Allowing regional characteristics to vary is a significant contribution
 to the literature on dynamic migration models such as for example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "kennan2003effect"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, since it provides an fundamental reason for agents to move in response
 to a change in their economic environment, rather than as a result of idiosyncr
atic preference shocks alone.
 Including time-varying location characteristics, however, increases computation
al demands substantially.
 To keep those demands tractable, the model employs a factor structure which
 allows aggregate shocks to affect regions differently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I estimate the model using a simulated method of moments estimator.
 I find that the model fits the data very well along the main dimensions
 of interest, which are mobility and ownership patterns over the lifecycle,
 ownership rates by region, migration flows across regions, as well as wealth
 accumulation over the lifecycle and by region.
 After fitting the model to the data, I first show how the model reacts
 to large regional shocks and then I move on to compute a measure of the
 value of the migration option for various sub populations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I find that owners and renters face very different incentives in the model.
 The probability of moving conditional on being a renter is consistently
 higher than the one for owners, and it varies considerably with income
 and assets.
 The model can be used to quantify the moving cost in terms of dollars,
 and I find that the estimates for renters and owners bracket the moving
 cost obtained in

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Migration is a low probability event in both data and model.
 Nevertheless, the welfare implications are large.
 I conduct an experiment where migration across regions is prohibited.
 In the baseline version, I compute the average lifetime utility of agents
 in the region under both scenarios, and I find that removing the option
 to move is valued at 5.1% of optimal per period consumption over the entire
 lifecycle ‚Äì a large value.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The baseline version assumes no change to regional prices as a a result
 of the policy; I provide three additional scenarios with different assumptions
 about how regional prices might change after introduction of the policy.
 The scenarios assume shocks ranging from large and negative to positive,
 and all imply even higher valuations of the forgone migration option than
 under observed prices.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Conditioning on young versus old household, one finds 7.6% for the former
 and 2.3% the latter.
 Given that the ownership rate varies significantly by age, one can see
 that young, mobile renters are the group which incurs the greatest welfare
 loss from reduced mobility.
 The results further show the prominent role of expectations about future
 potential moves, which may not have to be realized in the end.

, who are the first to develop a model of migration with multiple location
 choices over the lifecycle.
 Their main finding is that expected income is an important determinant
 of migration decisions, and their framework requires large moving costs
 to match observed migration decisions.
 The model features location-specific match effects in wages and amenity
 which are uncertain ex-ante, so the consumer has to move to a location
 in order to discover their values.
 The distributions of those match effects in each location are stationary.
 In their model, after having learned the value of the current location,
 the only reason for a move is a favourable realization of an i.i.d.
 preference shock which might occur in some future period ‚Äì there is no
 change in economic fundamentals which might encourage a move, like a shock
 to wages, for example.
 Relaxing this feature as well as adding housing and savings decisions are
 my main contributions to their paper.
 I am able to let regions experience differential income and price shocks
 over time, thereby providing an additional reason to move over and above
 idiosyncratic shocks.

 they are assumed to be independent in

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 assumes that job offers arrive in the current location from a random alternativ
e location.
 My assumption implies firstly that individuals consider all potential locations
 in each period, and decide to move based on their expectations about how
 they will fare in each.
 Secondly it allows for reasons other than job offers to trigger a move,
 which is a feature of the data, as I will show below.

 In light of state-specific shocks to labor demand, the authors find that

 to restore unemployment and participation rates back to trend in an affected

 Even unconditionally there are only 1560 unique cross-Division moves in

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 None of them tracks movers, so it is impossible to know the circumstances
 of an individual at the moment they decided to move, which is ultimately
 of interest in this paper.

It is possible to construct a panel dataset from the CPS, but only with
 postal address as unit identifier.
 If an individual moves out, this can be inferred from the data, however,
 the destination of the move cannot ‚Äì in particular it is unknown whether
 they relocated withing the city, or somewhere else.

 I therefore use the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) in
 this paper, a longitudinal and nationally representative dataset.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before presenting statistics from SIPP data, I will explain the geographic
 concept I will be using in this paper, which is a US Census Division.
 Census Divisions are nine relatively large regions which separate the United
 States into groups of states

To a first approximation, those regions represent areas with a common housing
 and labor market.
 In the model, a move within any region is not considered as migration and
 therefore does not contribute to the overall migration rate.
 This implies that there is a proportion of moves across markets that do
 happen in the data, but which are not picked up by my geographic definition
 of a market.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aggregation of states into this particular grouping is but one of many
 possibilities, and I adopt this particular partition based on computational
 constraints.
 In many respects the ideal concept of a region is what economists would
 refer to as a local labor market, and metropolitan statistical areas (MSA)
 or commuting zones (CZ) come close to this.
 Unfortunately, for the purpose of the model in this paper, the so‚Äìdefined
 number of regions would be far too large to be computationally feasible.
 Hence the choice of census divisions.
\begin_inset Foot

The model presented below contains 25.4 million different points in the state
 space at which to solve a savings problem.
 Increasing the number of regions to 51 (to represent US states) increases
 this to 815 million points in the state space.
 Given that estimation requires evaluation of the model solution many times
 over, the former state space can be handled with code that is highly optimized
 for speed, while the latter cannot.

Descriptive Statistics on Cross Division Migration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I combine four panels of SIPP data (1996, 2001, 2004 and 2008) into a database
 with 102,529 individuals that I can follow over time and space.
 From this dataset, a couple of interesting facts emerge.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Annual-moving-rate"

\end_inset

 presents some summary annual moving rates for both state and Census Division
 level migration.
 The overall unconditional migration rate is 1.95% and 1.32% per year for
 cross state and cross division, respectively.
 The cross state figure differs from the 2% in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Migration-rates-Molloy"

\end_inset

 because I set up the SIPP data in terms of household heads, thereby missing
 some moves of non‚Äìreference persons, and potentially because of sample
 attrition.
 It is quite clear from table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Annual-moving-rate"

\end_inset

 that there is a marked distinction in the likelihood of moving across state
 as well as division boundaries between renters and owners, with 2.6% (1.85%)
 of renters versus 0.93% (0.7%) of owners moving across state (division) boundarie
s on average per year.
 In total I observe of 2684 cross Division moves made by 2329 unique individuals
, implying multiple moves for some movers, see table

 that there is a strongly declining age effect ‚Äì younger individuals move
 more.
 Both of those are highly salient features of the data, and they are the
 main dimension along which my model's performance is going to be evaluated.
 Finally, a summary regarding homeownership rates and median price to income

\begin_layout Paragraph
Determinants of Migration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The March Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS) contains several
 questions relevant for the study of migration.
 Here I analyse answers to the 2013 edition of the CPS to the question 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What was the main reason for moving
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 where respondents are offered 19 options to choose from.
 The results are displayed in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:CPS-reason-move"

\end_inset

, and the caption to the table provides the key according to which I group
 the 19 options into four categories.
 It is striking to note that even though we are conditioning on moves across
 Division boundaries (and thus think of long-range moves), the percentage
 of people citing category 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

housing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as their main motivation is roughly 24% of the total population of movers.
 The table also disagreggates the response to the question by the distance
 between origin and destination state (not Division), and we can see that
 the proportion of respondents does vary with distance moved, but not to
 an extent that would suggest that housing becomes irrelevant as a motivation
 with increasing distance.
 Summing up in the bottom row of the table, we see that 55% say work was
 the main reason, 24% refer to housing and the remaining 21% is split between
 family and other reasons.
 The model to be presented below addresses each of these categories: Individuals
 can move out of work-related concerns (regional and individual level income
 fluctuations), because of housing considerations (regional house price
 fluctuation), for family reasons (stochastic age-dependent arrival of children)
 as well reasons classified as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

other
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which are accounted for by an idiosyncratic preference shock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:D2D-probit"

\end_inset

 I present estimates from a statistical analysis of the determinants of
 cross division moves from SIPP data, abstracting away from the severe endogenei
ty issues which the structural model below will account for.
 I regress a binary indicator for whether or not a cross division move took
 place in a given year on a set of explanatory variables which relate to
 the household in question in a probit regression.
 The table shows marginal effects computed at the sample mean of each variable,
 as well as the ratio of marginal effects to the baseline unconditional
 probability of moving (1.32%).
 The results indicate that there is a pronounced age effect, with each additiona
l year of age implying a reduction that is equal to 6% of the baseline probabili
ty.
 The same effect is found for whether or not children are present in the
 household.
 The effect of being a homeowner is very large and equivalent to a reduction
 in the propensity to move of 51% of the baseline probability.
 Increasing household income by $100,000 is equivalent to a 5% baseline
 baseline increase.
 Finally, having a college degree has an effect of equal magnitude than
 being a homeowner, but in the opposite direction: a college degree amounts
 to an increase of the baseline of 49%.
 According to this model, the effect of being a homeowner on the baseline
 moving probability is equal to an age increase of 8.3 years, thus taking
 a 30-year old to age 38; also, a household which owns the house would have
 to experience an increase in household income of $1m in order to make up
 for the implied loss in the probability of moving across divisions from
 being an owner.
 The house price to income ratio does not play a significant role in this
 specification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Regional Income and House Price Risk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a final piece of motivation I present an overview of the variation in
 house price and average income at the division level.
 I mentioned above that the shocks to each region exhibit a strong correlation
 as well as a high degree of persistence.
 This is best to see using a plot of the time series of regional house price
 and average income indices and how they relate to the national average
 of that index.
 Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Regional-House-Price-data"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Regional-Income-data"

\end_inset

 present the results of such an exercise.
 In both cases, we can see that nationwide shocks occur to varying degrees
 at the regional level; and that all series exhibit a high degree of persistence
, i.e.
 they are visibly different from an i.i.d.
 process.
 The model I will present now takes those patterns seriously and proposes
 a way to solve and estimate the resulting high-dimensional problem.

 Underlying this is an assumption about non‚Äìequalizing factor prices across
 regions.
 It is plausible to think that within a single country, wages should tend
 to converge to a common level, particularly in the presence of large migratory
 flows from one region to the next.
 In assuming no relative factor price equalization across US regions I rely
 on a host of evidence showing that relative wages vary considerably across
 regions over a long time horizon (see for example

 The mapping is defined in terms of a function that depends on both aggregate

One could say that the formulation is missing a shock, e.g.

 Adding such a shock would increase the state space by a factor equal to
 the number of integration nodes to be used for the approximation of the
 resulting integral, which is a big cost.
 I don't expect any major difference in my results.
 The fit of this approximation is very good, as will be shown further below.

Moving Costs.

Moving is costly both in monetary terms (see the budget constraints below

) and in terms of utility.
 Denote 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta(d,x)$

 the utility costs of moving from 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 at a current value of the state vector 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 Moving costs differ between renters and owners.
 Moving for an owner requires to sell the house, which in turn requires
 some effort and time costs.
 This is in addition to any other psychological costs incurred from moving
 states which are common between renters and owners.
 I specify the moving cost function as linear in parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta(d,x)=\alpha_{0,\tau}+\alpha_{1}j+\alpha_{2}j^{2}+\alpha_{3}h_{ij-1}+\alpha_{4}s_{ij}\label{eq:moving-cost}

In expression 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{0,\tau}$

The unobserved moving cost type 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\in\{0,1\}$
\end_inset

, where

 indexes the high type, is a parsimonious way to account for the fact that
 in the data, some individuals never move.
 This is of particular relevance when thinking about owners, who may self‚Äìselect
 into ownership because they know they are unlikely to ever move.
 In the model this selection mechanism, together with any other factor that
 implies a high unobservable location preference, is collapsed into a type
 of person that has prohibitively high moving costs (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{0,\tau=1}$
\end_inset

 is large) and thus is unlikely to move.

 In my sample I observe less than 1% of movers for which this appears to

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The moving cost function does not contain a term relating to distance of
 the move, which seems like a very intuitive thing to consider.
 This was not included because I could not find data moments that separately
 identify the cost of distance from the local amenity 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{k}$
\end_inset

 So a model with a regional fixed effect 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{k}$
\end_inset

 is isomorphic to one with an additional distance term in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta(d,x)$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly,
\end_layout

\end_inset

 A different way to formalize the idea of the high moving cost type 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$

 would be to allow for a nested structure of preference shocks, and/or a
 random preference for the current location that creates a home‚Äìbias in
 the same way as 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 does.
 Again, given that each of those represents a particular parametric assumption
 and we cannot use data to tell us which one is more relevant (at least
 in the context of this model), I regard those formulations as close to
 equivalent.

 Labor income is defined in equation

 as introduced in section

 Buyers can borrow against the value of their house and are required to
 make a proportional downpayment amounting to a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$

 of the value at purchase, while renters cannot borrow at all.
 This is embedded in constraint 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 must be greater or equal to the fraction of the purchase price that was
 financed via the mortgage, or non-negative otherwise.
 Constraint number 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

Owners.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For individuals entering the period as owners 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(h_{ij-1}=1\right)$
\end_inset

, the budget constraint is similar except for two differences which relate
 to the borrowing constraint and transfers in case they sell the house.
 Owners are not required to make a scheduled mortgage payment ‚Äì a gradual
 reduction of debt, i.e.
 an increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, arises naturally from the terminal condition 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{iJ}+p_{t}h_{iJ-1}\geq0,\forall t$
\end_inset

, as mentioned above.
 Therefore the budget of the owner is only affected by the house price in
 case they decide to sell the house, i.e.
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{ij}=0$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, they obtain the house price net of the proportional selling
 cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

, plus they have to pay rent in region 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

For moving renters the budget constraint is close to identical, with the

Owners.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The budget constraint for moving owners depends on the house price in both
 current and destination regions 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 since the house in the current region must be sold by assumption.
 The expression 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-\phi)p_{dt}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:budget-own-1"

\end_inset

 relates to proceeds from sale of the house in region 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, whereas the square brackets describe expenditures in region 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 Notice also that the borrowing constraint 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:budget-own-borrow-1"

\end_inset

 now is a function of the value of the new house in 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 It is important to note that this formulation precludes moving with negative
 equity if labor income is not enough to cover it.
 This is exacerbated in cases where the mover wants to buy immediately in
 the new region, since in that case the downpayment needs to be made as
 well, i.e.
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{ijdt}<a_{ij}+(1-\phi)p_{dt}-\chi h_{ij}p_{kt}$
\end_inset

 then the budget set is empty and moving and buying is infeasible.

In my sample I observe 29 owners who move with negative equity (amounting
 to 3.4% of moving owners).
 78% of those do buy in the new location, the rest rent.
 I do not observe whether or not an owner defaults on the mortgage.
 Accounting for this subset of the population would require to 1) assume
 that they actually defaulted and 2) it would substantially increase the
 computational burden.
 For those reasons the model cannot account for this subset of the mover
 population at the moment.

Solving and Simulating the Model

\begin_layout Standard
The model described above is a typical application of a mixed discrete‚Äìcontinuou

 In the next section I will introduce a nested fixed point estimator, which
 requires repeated evaluation of the model solution at each parameter guess,
 thus placing a binding time-contraint on time each solution may take.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The consumption/savings problem to be solved at each state, and its combination
 with multiple discrete choices and borrowing constraints, introduces several
 non-differentiabilities in the asset dimension of the value function.
 This makes using fast first order condition‚Äìbased approaches to solve the
 consumption problem more difficult.

 or

 for example because of data limitations.
 I experimented in particular with the latter paper's approach but soon
 had to give up because of too many empty cells in the empirical choice
 probability matrix (e.g.
 an entry like 
\begin_inset Formula $\Pr(\text{own},\text{save}=s,\text{move}|X)$
\end_inset

 would be empty for many values of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

; in general, my problem was to recover the first stage decision rules form
 the data in a satisfactory kind of way).
\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I solve the model in a backward-recursive way, starting at maximal age 50
 and going back until initial age 20.
 In the final period the known value is computed at all relevant states.
 From period 
\begin_inset Formula $J-1$
\end_inset

 onwards, the algorithm in each period iterates over all state variables
 and computes a solution to the savings problem at each combination of state
 and discrete choices variables (including housing and location choices).
 Notice that this state space spans all values for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}_{t}$
\end_inset

 observed over the sample period.
 After this solution is obtained at a certain state, the discrete housing
 choice is computed, after which each conditional value function 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:v"

\end_inset

 is known.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the solution is obtained, simulation of the model proceeds by using
 the model implied decision rules and the observed aggreate prices series
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}_{t}$
\end_inset

 as well as their regional dependants 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(q_{dt},p_{dt}\right)$
\end_inset

 to obtain simulated lifecycle data.
 As I will explain in greater detail in the next section, this proceedure
 needs to replicate the time and age structure found in the data, which
 is achieved by simulating different cohorts, starting life in 1967 and
 all successive years up until 2012.
 The model moments are then computed using the empirical age distribution
 found in the estimation sample as sampling weights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Estimation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section I explain how the model is estimated to fit some features
 of the data.
 There is a set of preset model parameters, the values of which I either
 take from other papers in the literature or I estimate them outside of
 the structural model and treat them as inputs.
 The remaining set of parameters are estimated using the simulated method
 of moments (SMM) approach, whereby given a set of parameters, the model
 is used to compute decision rules of agents, which in turn are used to
 simulate artificial data.
 I decided to choose SMM over maximum likelihood mainly because I need to
 combine several datasets.
 For example, the SIPP does not have information on long-duration moments
 (like number of moves over lifecycle), and the PSID does not have enough
 observations to construct a region by region transition matrix conditional
 on my state vector.

A copula is a multivariate probability distribution function which connects
 univariate margins by taking into account the underlying dependence structure.
 For example, a finite state Markov transition matrix is a nonparametric
 approximation to a bivariate copula, and they converge as the number of
 states goes to infinity, see

 Averaging over years was necessary to preserve a reasonable sample size
 in all conditioning cells.
 However, it also introduces an initial conditions and cohort effects problem,
 since, for example, a 30-year-old in 1997 faced a different economic environmen
t over their lifecycle than a similar 30-year-old in 2012 would have.
 The challenge is to construct an artificial dataset from simulated data,
 which has the same time and age structure as the sample taken from the
 data ‚Äì in particular, agents in the model should have faced the same sequence
 of aggregate shocks as their data counterparts from the estimation sample.
 This requires to simulate individuals starting in different calendar years,
 taking into account the actual observed time series for regional house
 prices and incomes.
 I describe the proceedure in detail in the appendix.

Identification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Identification is achieved by comparing household behaviour under different
 price regimes.
 The variation comes from using the observed house price and labor productivity
 series in estimation, which vary over time and by region.
 The identifying assumption is that, conditional on all other model features,
 households must be statistically identical across those differing price
 regimes.
 In particular, this requires that household preferences be stable over
 time and do not vary by region.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The model is not non-parametrically identified; Both variation in prices
 and further restrictions such as functional form are needed, because price
 variation is at the regional (and not household-) level.

\begin_inset Formula $m(\theta)$
\end_inset

 respond to a change in 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$

 However it is possible to use graphical analysis to show how some moments

Regarding parameters of the moving cost function, parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{0,\tau=0},\alpha_{3},\alpha_{4}$
\end_inset

 represent the intercept for low moving cost types, the coefficent on ownership
 and the effect of household size on moving costs, respectivley.
 They are related to, in order, the average moving rate 
\begin_inset Formula $E[\text{move}]$
\end_inset

, the moving rate conditional on owning 
\begin_inset Formula $E[\text{move}|h_{t}=1]$
\end_inset

, and the moving rate conditional on household size 
\begin_inset Formula $E[\text{move}|s_{t}=1]$
\end_inset

.
 The age effects 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}$
\end_inset

 are related to the age‚Äìcoefficients of the auxiliary model for moving,
 defined in expression 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:auxmod-move"

\end_inset

, as well as the the average proportion of movers in the last period of
 life 
\begin_inset Formula $E[\text{move}|T]$
\end_inset

.
 The relationship between mobility and ownership, as well as mobility and
 household size are also captured by the covariances 
\begin_inset Formula $Cov(\text{move},h)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Cov(\text{move},s)$
\end_inset

, both of which are again related to the moving cost parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{3}$

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{4}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proportion of high moving cost types 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 is related to the data moments concering the number of moves per person,
 and in particular the fraction of individuals who never moved, 
\begin_inset Formula $E[\text{moved never}]$
\end_inset

.
 The other two moments on the frequency of moves, 
\begin_inset Formula $E[\text{moved once}]$

\begin_inset Formula $E[\text{moved twice+}]$

 help to identify all moving cost parameters.

The model fits the data moments fairly well overall.
 The moment vector 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 contains conditional means and covariances, which are largely self-explanatory.
 I introduce two auxiliary models inluded in 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 which relate to the age profiles of both migration and ownership.
 Both models are linear probability models, where the dependent variable
 is either ownership status at the beginning of the period, 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{it-1}$
\end_inset

, or whether a move took place, denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{move}_{it}=\mathbf{1}\left[d_{it}\neq d'_{it}\right]$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
h_{it} & = & \beta_{0,h}+\beta_{1,h}t_{it}+\beta_{2,h}t_{it}^{2}+u_{h,it}\label{eq:auxmod-h}\\
\text{move}_{it} & = & \beta_{0,m}+\beta_{1,m}t_{it}+\beta_{2,m}t_{it}^{2}+u_{m,it}\label{eq:auxmod-move}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

The fit is displayed in tables 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:fit-model-and-data"

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

.
 The upper panel of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:fit-model-and-data"

\end_inset

 shows moments related to mobility, the lower panel shows moments related
 to homeownership.
 Regarding mobility, the fit is very good.
 The only statistic slightly out of line is the frequency distribution of
 moves per mover.
 There is no mechanism in the model that could generate the observed pattern
 in the data.
 One possibility would be to augment the set of moving cost types with a
 third type that has an even lower moving cost.
 The estimates for the auxiliary model defined in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:auxmod-move"

\end_inset

 representing the age profile in ownership also provide a good fit to the
 data.
 Looking at table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:fit-model-and-data-flows"

\end_inset

 we see that the average flows into each region are reasonably close to
 the data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moving on to moments related to ownership, we see that the unconditional
 mean of ownership is identical to the data moment.
 Condition by region provides a more varied picture, with some regions overestim
ated and others underestimated.
 The reason for this is that there is heterogeneity in ownership rates by
 region which is not easily accounted for by the fundamentals of regional
 house price and mean income alone.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There is large degree of house price heterogeneity at the local level with
 is not in the model but which contributes to the average ownership rate
 at the regional level.
 Local building regulations, rent control or certain topographical features
 all influence the actual house price that the local level; The price index
 used in the model incurs some unavoidable aggregation error in this respect,
 and the same holds for my estimate of the average rent to price ratio.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Remember that by taking prices and incomes as given, the model is restricted
 to only few levers that affect the homeownership rate.
 The main parameters in this respect are the utility premia 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{1},\xi_{2}$
\end_inset

 and the weight in the final period utility 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

.
 The model at the moment overpredicts ownership in later periods of life.
 This is visible from the intercept of the auxiliary model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:auxmod-h"

\end_inset

, which relates the ownership rate to an age profile.
 The reason for this is that in a model where age and wealth are the main
 dimensions of variation across households, as soon as a certain wealth
 threshold is crossed, all agents become owners.
 In other words, the model cannot account for wealthy houeholds who prefer
 not to own.
 One way to improve in this dimension would be to introduce different types
 of housing preferences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that the CRRA coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is taken as fixed in the current implementation of the model, the moments
 relating to wealth resulting from the model can be viewed as some form
 of model validation.
 The model moments in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 by the estimation algorithm.
 Despite this, they are very close the data counterparts.

 more pleasant to look, and I present this in figures

Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will now move on to describe the results of this paper.
 I will first investigate the dollar value of moving costs, before answering
 the question of why owners move less through the lens of the model.
 Finally I will present the main set of results pertainting to the value
 of the migration option.

\begin_layout Subsection
Quantifying Moving Costs 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moving costs in the model are measured in terms of utility.
 I convert them to dollar values by finding the amount of compensating assets
 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{*}$
\end_inset

 which would make an individual at state 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 indifferent between the value of moving with costs 
\begin_inset Formula $(v)$
\end_inset

 (but extra assets) and without 
\begin_inset Formula $(\tilde{v})$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, dollar‚Äìvalued moving costs are measured by 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{*}$
\end_inset

 which solves
\begin_inset Foot

with some abuse of notation: 
\begin_inset Formula $x+a^{*}$
\end_inset

 means 
\emph on
add 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{*}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset


\emph default
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, 
\emph on
leaving everything else the same.
\end_layout

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
v(x+a^{*},1)-\tilde{v}(x,1) & = & 0\\
x & = & \left(a_{ij},z_{ij},s_{ij},\mathbf{F}_{t},h_{ij-1},d,\tau,j\right)\\
 & = & \left(0,\underline{z},0,\overline{\mathbf{F}},h_{ij-1},2,0,1\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

The measure is taken at a state 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 where the individual has zero asset, is at the lowest income shock state
 
\begin_inset Formula $\underline{z}$
\end_inset

, has no children, is not of type

\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 are at the midpoint of their respective grids.
 The proposed move is to region 1.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kennan2003effect"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, the moving costs are large.
 As they explain, this is because 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

[the estimated moving costs] do not refer to the costs of moves that are
 actually made, but rather to the costs of hypothetical moves to arbitrary
 locations.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 The results are displayed in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:MC-money"

\end_inset

 where we see moving costs for renters are $147,111 and $547,473 for owners.
 These estimates bracket the average cost of $312,000 reported in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kennan2003effect"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This is reassuring, since their model is a weighted average of owners and
 renters.
 A simple calculation reveals that using my estimates and an ownership rate
 of 61% as found in the data, one obtains 
\begin_inset Formula $147,000\times0.39+547,000\times0.61=391,000$

 dollars of average moving costs.

\begin_layout Subsection
Why Do Owners Move Less?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several reasons for why owners move less than renters.
 First, they have higher moving costs as implied by a positive estimate
 for parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 Second, owners pay a transaction cost each time they sell the house (proportion
al cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

), so any (expected) gains from migration need to be traded off against
 this financial cost.
 Third, owners have to comply with the downpayment constraint if they wish
 to buy in the new region, which puts restrictions on the consumption paths
 of movers.
 Most owners will indeed return to ownership status in the new region, given
 the utility benefits, and given that in principle they are above the downpaymen
t constraint.
 Fourth, ownership is correlated with larger household size 
\begin_inset Formula $(s=1)$
\end_inset

, which itself carries a higher moving cost 
\begin_inset Formula $(\alpha_{4})$
\end_inset

.
 Last but certainly not least, a large proportion of owners is of the stayer
 type because they self-select into ownership as was discussed in section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Moving"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The ownership rate conditional only on moving cost type is 0.59 for movers
 
\begin_inset Formula $(\tau=0)$
\end_inset

 vs 0.64 for stayers 
\begin_inset Formula $(\tau=1)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To investigate those issues in more detail, I sequentially remove owner-specific
 moving costs in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Decomposing-owner's-moving"

\end_inset

 from the model .
 The aim is to understand the relative importance of both financial transaction
 cost and utility cost.
 If we see a large reaction of the model‚Äìgenerated moments after setting
 a certain cost component to zero, we can conclude that this component is
 relatively important to explain the data.
 Starting therefore in the top panel of table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Decomposing-owner's-moving"

\end_inset

, we see changes in three key moments when considering first all types of
 households.
 The first row shows the percentage change in the ownership rate for different
 configurations of the model parameters.
 Setting the utility cost of moving for owners to zero in the column labelled
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{3}=0$
\end_inset

 increases the ownership rate by 1.72%, because this makes owning a more
 attractive option in case of the need to migrate.
 Similarly, abolishing the financial transaction cost from selling in column
 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi=0$
\end_inset

 leads to an even bigger increase of 2.58%.
 In the final column 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\phi=0$
\end_inset

, combining both changes, we see an increase of 4.44% in ownership.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second row shows the same experiment for the migration rate.
 Here the direct impact of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{3}=0$
\end_inset

 is larger than removal of the financial transaction cost, and it leads
 to roughly a 7% increase in overall migration.
 The third row finally conditions on owners in order to emphasize that most
 migratory movement comes from renters to start with, so the previous experiment
 masks a great deal of heterogeneity.
 Here we see large increases in the migratory propensity of owners after
 removing the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{3}$
\end_inset

 cost component.
 Overall, the first panel shows that both cost components affect both ownership
 and migration, with the relative importance of each as one would expect:
 owners' utility cost of migration, 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{3}$
\end_inset

, is more important in determining migration flows, and vice versa for the
 financial transaction cost and ownership choices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The bottom panel of the table repeat this exercise while conditioning only
 on the 
\emph on
mover 
\emph default
population, i.e.
 types 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=0$
\end_inset

.
 This helps to further clarify the top panel, where the results are from
 a mixture of stayers and movers.
 It is interesting to note that among the movers, the impacts on ownership
 rate are greater than for the population at large, whereas those on migration
 of owners are smaller throughout.
 The former is a consequence of 
\emph on
stayers 
\emph default
being overrepresented in the group of owners already, hence see a smaller
 increase in ownership in the top panel.
 The latter effect is the converse of this, in the sense that the larger
 numbers for increased migration in the top panel comes from a few stayer
 types, who 
\emph on
do 
\emph default
in fact move, now that costs are lower.

The value of Migration
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "subsec:The-value-of"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section presents a measure of how much individuals care about having
 the option to migrate across regions.
 The question is motivated by relatively low migratory flows across regions,
 1.32% of households per year, as initially stated.
 Do low flows imply low value? And how does this valuation depend on age,
 location, ownership status, and current state of the business cycle? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I will attempt to answer this set of questions by first simulating the model
 in the baseline equilibrium, i.e.
 at observed regional prices and incomes and importantly, 
\emph on
with migration
\emph default
 as an option.
 Subsequently I will compare this to a counterfactual equilibrium 
\emph on
without 
\emph default
the migration option, i.e.
 migration is shut down in the entire economy.
 Even though trade is absent from the model, it helps the interpretation
 to assume that existing trade channels between regions remain intact throughout
 the experiment, i.e.
 we only expect changes from the absence of individuals changing location.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before delving into the results it is paramount to clarify the role of the
 partial equilibrium assumption in this counterfactual.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Thanks to an anonymous referee for insisting on this point.

\end_inset

 Assuming that the model is well-specified, the structural parameters are
 such that given prices and incomes, the resulting decision rules of agents
 in the model are correct.
 This mapping from model to data was shown to be satisfactory in section
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "subsec:Parameter-Estimates"

\end_inset

.
 What this model cannot deliver is a prediction of how the 
\emph on
exogenous
\emph default
 series for 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 would change if we were to abolish migration.
 To address this concern at least to some degree, I will present different
 scenarios of this counterfactual, a baseline version with prices unchanged,
 and a set of experiments with changed prices.
 There is no direct empirical guidance on the effects of such a drastic
 experiment on regional house prices and labor income levels, except maybe
 that 
\emph on
in general, 
\emph default
wage effects of immigration are 
\emph on
small
\emph default
.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I take this insight from the literature that assesses the impact of immigrants
 on native wages, exemplified by, for example, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "dustmann2008labour,dustmann2013effect,card2012comment"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, which finds negligible negative impacts of immigrants on wages of low-skilled
 workers, and slightly positive ones elsewhere along the income distribution.
 Needless to say that the current model is a much simplified version of
 those studies in terms of skill composition of the labor force and indeed
 wage determination ‚Äì it abstracts from immigrants (i.e.
 different skills groups and wage determination) altogether, hence it is
 probably too remote in order to directly use their results.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Absent such empirial evidence, I try to cover the most relevant cases.
 Version two thus decreases both regional incomes and prices by 1% relative
 to their observed trajectories after the shutdown of migration.
 This could arise as a result of decreased firm productivity from the lack
 of suitable (migrant) skills, which leads to lower disposable income in
 a given region and hence a reduction in house prices.
 Version three simulates a bust scenario, where incomes decline by 5% and
 house prices by 10%.
 A final version shows results under the assumption that a large increase
 in owner-occupied housing after the shutdown fuels a price increase.
 Summing up, this experiment is available in four versions:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Baseline 
\begin_inset Formula $\{q_{dt},p_{dt}\}_{t=1997}^{2012}$
\end_inset

: Loss of migrants has negligible impact on regional prices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
-1% shock to 
\begin_inset Formula $\{q_{dt},p_{dt}\}_{t=1997}^{2012}$
\end_inset

: Local productivity suffers a small loss.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
-5%/-10% shock: Large productivity decline and amplified effect on house
 prices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
No change to 
\begin_inset Formula $\{q_{dt}\}_{t=1997}^{2012}$
\end_inset

, but house prices 
\emph on
increase 
\emph default
by +5%: This could arise in case of a strong increase of demand for owner-occupi
ed housing, while local productivity remains unchanged.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Starting with a scenario where prices are unaffected by the experiment,
 table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:shutdown-cons-base"

\end_inset

 shows in the first row the consumption compensation demanded in the entire
 economy, for different subsets of the population, including young, old,
 owners at age 30, renters at age 30, and the entire population.
 The values in the table stand for the proportional per period increase
 in consumption that would make individuals indifferent between baseline
 and migration shutdown.
 For example, the group of young people (with age below half of their lifespan)
 would demand 1.076 times what they consume in the baseline in each period,
 or an increase of 7.6% of per period consumption.
 This amount is lower for old people at 2.3%, which is intuitive since they
 forgo fewer periods where the migration could have been optimally chosen.
 We can look at the same measure by ownership status at age 30: owners at
 that age demand 3.8% more consumption, while same aged renters demand almost
 double that, i.e.
 6.3%.
 Part of this difference comes from the fact that stayer types know that
 they will not move, hence are more likely to buy, hence suffer less from
 a removal of the migration option.
 As an average over all individuals treated in this experiment (ATE), the
 corresponding number is 5.1% of consumption compensation demanded.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the same table we the continue with this exercise and split the sample
 by region to understand how heterogeneous those valuations are distributed.
 Perhaps not surprisingly, there is a lot of variation in how individuals
 feel about removal of the migration option by region.
 In general, living in a high-income, high-price region like Pacific accentuates
 the difference between young and old even more (7.9% vs 0.6% compensation
 demanded).
 Put simply, this is because high prices are good for owners, who are more
 likely to stay in the region no matter what, but bad for renters who cannot
 afford to buy a house.
 They would prefer to migrate at some point if necessary and therefore suffer
 disproportionately from the removal of the migration option.
 By way of summary of this table, individuals value having the option of
 migration to a large degree and in the range of -2% (young owners in East
 South Central prefer not having the option to move) and up to 13% of per
 period consumption.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Versions two, three and four of this experiment are described in appendix
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Migration-Shutdown-with"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, where the general conclusions from this series of results goes through,
 with the qualification that the bigger the price shock after migration
 shutdown, the more individuals value the baseline.
 Interestingly, this is true even for the case when house prices are assumend
 to 
\emph on
increase 
\emph default
as in version number four.
 As will be highlighted in the next subsection and the relevant appendix,
 this is easy to understand if one knows that the next best option to migrating
 is to buy a better house, in case one is barred from migrating (and in
 case it's affordable).
 This sequence of counterfactuals tells us that the estimates from the baseline
 scenario with observed prices provide a lower bound.
 If in reality a general equilibrium effect would change regional incomes
 downwards, and prices down 
\emph on
or 
\emph default
upwards, the valuation of the migration option would be larger than displayed

\begin_layout Subsection
Effects along lifecycle, business cycle, ownership and location
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have shown that lifetime utility changes dramatically with the removal
 of migration.
 We now go further and investigate where those changes come from, i.e.
 how do the state variables of individuals in the model change? In the following
, we focus only on the main counterfactual with constant prices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Starting out with the lifecycle considerations, the results are presented
 in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:noMove-lifecycle"

\end_inset

.
 The first panel in the top row in some ways repeats the insights from the
 previous section: younger individuals suffer particularly, experiencing
 a loss as in lifetime utility of almost 15% in the first period of life.
 As time goes by, the losses get smaller until they vanish towards the end
 of the lifecycle.
 We observe in the next panel that removing migration implies a substantial
 drop in average income at all ages.
 It may look like a small effect that income should drop by half a percent
 for 26 to 50 year olds, but bear in mind that this is an average over the
 entire population.
 This implies that some profitable moves in terms of better wage draw could
 not be completed as a result of the policy.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The next two panels for 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 are best viewed in conjunction, as they are tightly connected: After migration
 is abolished, the aggregate homeownership rate increases strongly for 30
 year-olds, and with it the outstanding mortgage balance as measured by
 negative net assets 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 In light of the fixed regional price series 
\begin_inset Formula $\{q_{dt},p_{dt}\}_{t=1997}^{2012}$
\end_inset

 this result may be somewhat surprising.
 We observe that after migration is abolished, homeownership rises by about
 11% at age 30.
 Notice that this increase implies that far more than only the previous
 migrants now choose to buy, which was relatively small group of people.
 The increase in ownership comes from the fact that potential future moves
\emph on
 
\emph default
of 
\emph on
all individuals
\emph default
 have been ruled out, and therefore a much larger number of them finds it
 profitable to take out a mortgage and buy in the current (constant) location.
 This suggests that absent the option to move to a better region in response
 to shocks, the best thing to do is is to invest in more enjoyable housing
 in the current region in order to, in some sense, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

soften the blow
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Notice that this increase in ownership can be seen as a simple reallocation
 of previously rented real estate into owned one, i.e.
 one would not have to imagine construction of additional housing units
 (and ensuing price increases) because of this effect.
 The contrary case, i.e.
 prices increasing, is the topic of counterfactual number four in the previous
 section.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 The final two panels for 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 are merely a representation of previous moving decisions, since movers
 at all ages tended to, on average, move towards regions with higher regional
 income, which is correlated with higher regional prices.
 Therefore both panels, which show the average change in 
\emph on
realized 
\emph default
prices for simulated individuals, exhibit negative deviations from the baseline.

There are three additional figures which tell the same story from different

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:noMove-age30"

\end_inset

 I look at the experiment by measuring the effects for individuals who did
 and did not own their house by the age of 30.
 It shows that the bulk of the previous lifecyle results must be driven
 by young renters, as opposed to owners.
 Young owners in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:noMove-age30"

\end_inset

 have a smaller utility loss (panel 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 shows average period payoff) and they have about 0.2% higher income on average
 if they don't have to move.
 This is also reflected in the 
\begin_inset Formula $q,p$
\end_inset

 panels, indicating that on average they would have moved to lower income
 and price regions.
 This comes from the fact that their baseline moves were motivated by other
 considerations than regional price differences, given their relatively
 well off position in the baseline.

 illustrate that differences between regions where diminishing over the

 In other words, as the business cycles moved over the house price peak
 in 2008 and beyond, the moves of people in the baseline were to locations
 that were convergent relative to the earlier period in the sample.

Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main result of this paper is to show that despite average migration
 rates being low, the option value associated with the possibility to leave
 a location in a world with regional shocks to house prices and labor income
 is large.
 Removing the option to migrate in the model implies an associated reduction
 in lifetime utility that ranges from 0% up to almost 13% depending on the
 type of household one considers.
 Variations in this measure vary widely with age, ownership status, original
 location, and piont in the business cycle.
 To arrive at this result, I construct a lifecycle model which includes
 homeownership as a choice variable next to savings and location choices,
 which I then fit to SIPP data and use to make counterfactual experiments.
 Considering homeownership is motivated by the fact that well over 60% of
 the US population are owners, and the observation that owners exhibit vastly
 different migratory behaviour than renters.
 The model places particular emphasis on a close representation of the observed
 house price and income series, both of which exhibit strong correlation
 of regional shocks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model delivers structural estimates for differential moving costs between
 owners and renters, over and above financial transaction costs.
 It is shown that this moving cost component is first order in explaining
 differential moving rates between renters and owners, and that the implied
 monetary value of the moving costs for both groups bracket the cost from
 a previous model in

Solution
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The problem is fully discretized on a grid of points, however, the savings
 decision is allowed to be continuous.
 Linear interpolation is used to evaluate the value function between grid
 points.
 To compute the conditional expectation of the future value function in
 each period, I use the method proposed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Kopecky2010701"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 to discretize the continuous variable 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

.
 The expectation with respect to household size is a simple matrix operation,
 using the age-dependent transition matrices 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma_{s,t}$
\end_inset

.
 In order to compute the expectation with respect to the aggregate VAR(1)
 process, I define a grid for both 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 that spans all observed values in the data and compute the transition matrix
 from each combination of grid points in the current period 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{P}_{t}^{(ij)}\equiv\left(Y_{i},P_{j}\right)$
\end_inset

 to the set of all grid points in the next period 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{P}_{t+1}^{(mk)}\equiv\left(Y_{m},P_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The VAR(1) model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:VAR-process-1"

\end_inset

 implies that given 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{P}_{t}^{(ij)}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{P}_{t+1}^{(mk)}\sim N\left(A\mathbf{P}_{t}^{(ij)},\sigma_{\nu}^{2}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The transition matrix is then constructed by evaluating all grid points
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{P}^{(mk)}$
\end_inset

 in the pdf of this distribution, and by normalizing over rows.

 with scenario 2, we see the general pattern from the baseline experiment
 without changing prices going through: Individuals dislike the counterfactual
 world, with strong differences across regions and betwen age groups, and
 between renters and owners at young age.
 With the 1% shock on regional income and house price, the compensation
 demanded is slightly higher everywhere as compared to the baseline in table

 As explained in relation to figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:noMove-lifecycle"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

, buying a house is the preferred option of many individuals once moving
 is abolished.
 In terms of welfare, higher prices imply that more individuals are below
 the downpayment constraint, and thus suffer more from the abolishment of
 migration: not only can they not move over their entire lifecycle, but
 they also cannot compensate with the purchase of a better house.

 Denoting the standardized values by

 The results are shown in table

 This estimate together with the marginal distibutions of
