JOB MARKET PAPER DRAFT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
In this paper I propose a structural lifecycle model of consumption, savings
 and regional migration in the US which explicitly takes the decision to
 buy or rent a home into account.
 Given that labor income and house price risk are of first order importance
 for welfare, and given that both have a location specific element, the
 paper asks the question to which extent regional migration serves as a
 self insurance mechanism against regional economic shocks.
 Homeowners have greater costs of relocation, resulting in a lower propensity
 to move relative to renters, which has implications for how they can respond
 to such shocks.
 After fitting the model to match some important features of the data, I
 perform a series of counterfactual policy experiments.
 Policies which try to affect the rent/buy decision, like the abolition
 of the mortgage interest rate tax deduction, only marginally affect aggregate
 mobility.
 Policies which target the moving cost directly (government voucher for
 movers) are more effective.
 I find that the response to regional shocks is large.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The propensity of being a homeowner and the likelihood of moving across
 regions are negatively correlated.
 Owners move less because they have higher transaction and moving costs
 than renters.
 This negative correlation has important implications when considering the
 insurance mechanisms available to consumers in the face of regional shocks
 to housing and labor productivity.
 The possiblity of moving to another region in case the current region is
 hit by an economic shock is a way to self insure in a world of incomplete
 markets.
 The aim of this paper is firstly to investigate the value of this self
 insurance mechanism in terms of welfare, and secondly to establish how
 several government policies interact with it.
 To address both issues, I propose a lifecycle model of consumption and
 savings, housing tenure and location choice, where aggregate fluctuations
 affect prices in regions differentially, which leads to welfare effects
 of moving that depend on the extent of variation in those prices.
 Taking a lifecycle perspective is necessary to account for a strong age
 effect in both mobility and ownership, which in turn has implications for
 welfare statements about policies, since different age groups will be affected
 differently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Government policy plays an important role in both housing and labor markets.
 In a US context, housing policies such as the mortgage interest tax deduction,
 the backing of mortgages originated through government sponsored agencies
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as zoning restrictions and building
 regulations all have profound impacts on the incentives consumers face
 in the housing market.
 Each of those policies may have been implemented originally in part to
 address a certain economic inefficiency in housing and capital markets
 (e.g.
 a shortage of housing after the second World War and moral hazard concerns
 may have warranted a down payment for mortgages, creating liquidity constraints
 that warranted government backing to provide cheaper mortgages) and in
 part to respond to political pressures of the day (e.g.
 the desire of the median voter for large suburban houses and cheap commuting
 into town), and there is an well-informed debate in economics about the
 the desireability of each of them (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "glaeser2011rethinking"

\end_inset

).
 What is less well understood is how those policies interact with regional
 mobility when regional shocks occur, an anlysis of which is the contribution
 made by this paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 2013, 63% of occupied housing units in the US are owned, while 37% are
 rented.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
see American Community Survey 2013, table DP04.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 At the same time, the annual mobility rate across US census divisions is
 roughly 1.3% of the population, and it factors as 1.9% for renters and 0.67%
 for owners.
 These are large differences in the propensity to move, and the natural
 question to ask is why do we observe owners moving less? All else equal,
 owners face higher costs of effort when moving because they have to spend
 time finding a suitable buyer and meet with agents and lawyers and so forth
 -- in short, things a comparable renter does not have to contemplate.
 Additional to that, by buying a house owners make a specific investment
 into an asset that provides both a stream of utlility and a financial return,
 but is tied to a location.
 The stream of utility is only available if they reside in that location,
 and transaction costs imply that switching houses is costly, making owners
 more reluctant to move.
 It is conceivable that there is an interaction between a preference for
 a given location which influences the decision to make the investment.
 The model incorporates all of the aforementioned factors influencing owner's
 moving decisions and it allows for this potential interaction in preferences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the model I develop there are several mechanims which affect the home
 ownership choice of individuals.
 A downpayment requirement means that only individuals with sufficient cash
 on hand are eligible to buy a house at the current price.
 Given that income increases on average over the lifecycle and depending
 on the path their individual income shocks have taken, it will in general
 take several years of assets accumulation before this constraint is satisfied.
 Even though all individuals share a common preference for owning, not all
 will buy a house once the downpayment constraint is satisfied.
 This decision interacts with an unobserved moving cost type, where a high
 cost is supposed to capture a strong preference for the current location,
 implying that high cost types are more likely to own and less likely to
 move.
 Finally, regional variation in price to income ratios imply different ownership
 rates in different regions, reflecting the relative differences found in
 the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of the decision to migrate to another region, the model predicts
 that the likelihood of migration is increasing in the difference of discounted
 expected lifetime utilities between any two regions.
 This assumes that agents have rational expectations about the stochastic
 processes driving aggregate prices, and the way they affect their regional
 counterparts.
 As lifetime utility in one region decreases in response to a change in
 the aggregate house price level, say, the relative odds of moving from
 that region, to a region where the aggregate movement had a less negative
 impact, increase.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I estimate the preference parameters of the model using a simulated method
 of moments estimator which operates inside a parallel MCMC algorithm.
 I find that the model fits the data very well along the main dimensions
 of interest, which are mobility and ownership patterns over the lifecycle,
 ownership rates by region, as well as wealth accumulation over the lifecycle
 and by region.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results indicate that abolishing the mortgage interest rate deduction
 has a large impact on the mobility rate of young owners, if the tax receipts
 are redistributed as a lump sum payment at the beginning of life, but that
 any other (politically more feasible) redistribution mechanism results
 in negligible changes in overall mobility rates.
 Work in progress (from which there are no results in this draft yet) is
 focused on the effects of changing the variability the aggregate price
 and income series on mobility, the implications of the government addressing
 inefficient rental markets (resulting in lower rents), and the costs and
 benefits of a government program that subsidizes cross regional moves.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Literature.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several relevant strands of literature related to this paper.
 One strand is the labor literature on the determinants of individual migration
 decisions in dynamic models, as embodied by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kennan2003effect"

\end_inset

.
 This is a partial equilibrium model of the determinants of individual migration
 decisions across US states in a dynamic context, with a particular focus
 on the importance of return migration.
 The paper ignores housing market and savings considerations and finds that
 income prospects in other states are an important determinant of individual
 migration decisions.
 Using a similar setup, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gemici2007family"

\end_inset

 considers the joint location problem of couples where both partners are
 participating in the labor force.
 Casting the problem as an intra-household bargaining game over the lifecycle,
 she finds that family ties significantly hinder migration decisions and
 wage growth.
 Following in this tradition of models, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "gregory2013impact"

\end_inset

 analyzes the impact of a home-rebuilding grant extended to victims of the
 Katrina hurricane in New Orleans in a dynamic discrete choice model.
 My paper contributes to this literature by extending 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kennan2003effect"

\end_inset

 with a time-varying regional income and house price process, while at the
 same time including assets and housing status as a state variable.
 The combination of a lifecycle housing and savings problem in multiple
 locations with different price processes poses the main challenge in this
 extension.
 This extension is necessary for the study of migration as an insurance
 device to regional level price and income shocks in a dynamic setup.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A different and well--established literature on migration and local labor
 markets is based on the static spatial equilibrium concept going back to
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Roback:1982uq"

\end_inset

.
 In an authoritative handbook chapter, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Moretti:2011fk"

\end_inset

 provides an overview over much of this literature.
 As an example for a recent application, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Diamond:2012fk"

\end_inset

 analyses the welfare implications of geographic skill sorting in the US,
 whereby college graduates increasingly locate in high wage, high rent cities.
 This obfuscates any welfare comparisons, since high and low skilled pay
 different rents and consume different amenities, and she finds taking skill
 sorting into account substantially increases the welfare differential.
 I take from this literature the basic idea that welfare in any given location,
 and thus the decision to migrate to it, depends among other things on the
 tension between wages and rents in that location.
 At difference to this framework my model is dynamic, so it can capture
 the human capital investment aspect of migration, while having to relax
 the general equilibrium structure.

\begin_layout Standard
The paper is also related to the public finance literature, in particular
 to the tax treatment of housing in general and ownership in particular.
 Economists have long had good reasons to be critical of the US housing
 tax code

 He argues that public policy which encourages ownership through subsidy
 or building restrictions moves people away from dense, urban neighborhoods
 with predominatly rental accomodation and into suburban areas with owner
 occupied housing and long associated commutes.
 This is a distortion of a market where the need for public intervention
 is not obvious even after close scrutiny, and it affects inner city economic
 development and has large environmental consequences, reenforcing the need
 for policy change in the view of Glaeser.

 is a paper which fed into this conclusion, analysing the benefits of the
 home mortgage interest deduction.
 In it, the authors use a measure of the tax benefit to owners arising from
 the mortgage interest rate deduction similar to the one used in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Poterba:2008fk"

\end_inset

.
 They find that based on this measure, it seems there is no impact of the
 amount of the deduction on the aggregate homeownership rate in time series
 data, but only on the amount of housing consumed.
 As pointed out in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Poterba:2008fk"

\end_inset

, it is indeed the case that the amount of tax savings is increasing in
 household income, as higher income households are more likely to itemize
 their tax return, which is a precondition for applying for the deduction;
 However, the average tax savings for a households are still significant
 in all age and income brackets, as evident in panel B of table 1 therein.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a series of papers starting with 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "oswald1996conjecture"

\end_inset

 and leading up to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "blanchflower2013does"

\end_inset

, the authors advance the theory that homeownership is an impediment to
 labor market mobility.
 Initially based on cross-country regressions and later on state--level
 cross sectional data for the US, they find a statistical relationship between
 current unemployment and past homeownership at a lag of up to five years.
 As poptential mechanisms they cite negative externalities of homeownership
 on the wider labor market, in particular greater NIMBYism (Not In My Back
 Yard) reducing business creation and productive investments and lower attractio
n of no migrants, who may be important for economic growth but demand rental
 accomodation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Providing a more structural approach to the link between homeownership and
 unemployment, there is a growing literature analyzing if and how the recent
 house price crash has affected the reallocation of workers across locations,
 or if it affected the unemployment rate.
 The mechanisms are a variant of negative equity lock-in and search frictions
 in housing and labor markets.
 An incomplete list of contributions includes

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 At difference to those papers which focus on the equilibrium properties
 of housing and unemployment, here I spend a lot of effort in trying to
 model the budget constraint and instutional environment of a consumer as
 accurately as possible.
 In particular, age seems to be of first order importance in both housing
 and migration decisions in the data, which brings with it the need to consider
 a finite time horizon, implying that any mortgage taken out must be paid
 back at some point -- which is not implied by the previous set of papers.
 Furthermore, and as mentioned previously, it seems that the dynamics of
 house prices over the recent couple of decades are hard to reconcile with
 those models, which is particularly worrying if the exercise is to deliver
 estimates of structural parameters, as is the aim here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The contribution of this paper is to provide a link between models of housing
 demand over the lifecycle, as for example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Attanasio20121"

\end_inset

, with the literature on dynamic migration following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kennan2003effect"

\end_inset

.
 I find that housing is an important feature of the individual migration
 decision.
 The likelihood of any given move depends not only on whether or not the
 individual owns their house, but also on the price and income levels in
 all potential destination regions, and the current level of mortgage debt.
 To my knowledge this is the first empirical lifecycle model which takes
 the observed house price as given and models actual geographic location.

Empirical Background

\begin_layout Standard
Despite a recent declining trend, the amount of regional migration in the
 US is still relatively high by international standards.
 According to

, who use three publicly available datasets (American Community Survey (ACS),
 the Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the CPS (March CPS), and Internal
 Revenue Service (IRS) data), each year roughly 1.5% of the entire population
 moves between two out of four census regions, and about 1.3% move between
 states within any one region.
 At a more local level, they find that 5% of the population move between
 counties each year, which amounts to roughly one-third of the annual flows
 into and out of employment according to the measure in

To a first approximation, those regions represent areas with a common housing
 and labor market.
 In the model, a move within any region is not considered as migration and
 therefore does not contribute to the overall migration rate.
 This implies that when in this paper I refer to the effects of a certain
 policy on the migration rate at the census division level, this should
 be interpreted as a lower bound to the effects that would be found in a
 model where a lower level of geographic aggregation would be used, since
 there is a proportion of moves that do happen in the data, but which are
 not picked up by my geographic definition of a market.

\begin_layout Standard
The aggregation of states into this particular grouping is but one of many
 possibilities, and I adopt this particular partition based on computational
 constraints.
 In many respects the ideal concept of a region is what economists would
 refer to as a local labor market, and metropolitan statistical areas (MSA)
 or commuting zones (CZ) come close to this.
 Alas, for the purpose of the model in this paper, the so defined number
 of regions would be far too large to be computationally feasible.
 Hence the choice of census divisions.

 Increasing the number of regions to 51 (to represent US states) increases

 level migration.
 The overall unconditional migration rate is 1.95% and 1.32% per year for
 cross state and cross division, respectively.
 The cross state figure differs from the 2% in table

\end_inset

 most likely because I set up the SIPP data in terms of household heads,
 thereby missing some moves of non--reference persons, and potentially because
 of sample attrition.
 It is quite clear form table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 that there is a marked distinction in the likelihood of moving across state
 as well as division boundaries between renters and owners, with 2.6% (1.85%)
 of renters versus 0.93% (0.7%) of owners moving across state (division) boundarie
s on average per year.
 In total I observe of 2684 cross Division moves made by 2329 unique individuals
, implying multiple moves for some movers, see table

 I present estimates from a statistical analysis of the determinants of
 cross division moves from SIPP data.
 I regress a binary indicator for whether or not a cross division move took
 place in a given year on a set of explanatory variables which relate to
 the household in question in a probit regression.
 The table shows marginal effects computed at the sample mean of each variable,
 as well as the ratio of marginal effects to the baseline unconditional
 probability of moving (1.32%).
 The results indicate that there is a pronounced age effect, with each additiona
l year of age implying a reduction that is equal to 6% of the baseline probabili
ty.
 The same effect is found for whether or not children are present in the
 household.
 The effect of being a homeowner is very large and equivalent to a reduction
 in the propensity to move of 51% of the baseline probability.
 Increasing household income by $100,000 is equivalent to a 5% baseline
 baseline increase.
 Finally, having a college degree has an effect of equal magnitude than
 being a homeowner, but in the opposite direction: a college degree amounts
 to an increase of the baseline of 49%.
 According to this model, the effect of being a homeowner on the baseline
 moving probability is equal to an age increase of 8.3 years, thus taking
 a 30-year old to age 38; also, a household which owns the house would have
 to experience an increase in household income of $1m in order to make up
 for the implied loss in the probability of moving across divisions from
 being an owner.

Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the model I view households as unitary units, and I'll use the terms
 
\emph on
household 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
individual
\emph default
 interchangeably in what follows.
 Individuals are assumed to live in census Division (or 
\emph on
region
\emph default
) 
\begin_inset Formula $d\in D$
\end_inset

 for a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 years of age.
 At each age 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, individual 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 has to decide whether to move to a different region, whether to own or
 rent, and how much of his labor income to save.
 Individuals derive utility from consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

, from owning a house 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 and an unobservable location preference shock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Individuals are subject to uncertainty at both the aggregate and individual
 level.
 At the aggregate level, regional house price 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and income levels 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{y}$
\end_inset

 fluctuate.
 This allows some scope for regional migration as an insurance mechanism.
 The regional fluctuations are driven by a common set of low dimensional
 stochastic factors denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

.
 This reflects the fact the regional shocks to both house prices and average
 labor income are highly correlated.
 It also allows for fluctuations in the underlying aggregate factors 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 to have differential impacts across regions, while maintaining a degree
 of computational tractability.
 Every individual in region 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 faces an identical level of house price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{dt}$
\end_inset

 and mean income 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{y}_{dt}$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Additional to that, 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{y}_{dt}$
\end_inset

 enters the individual wage equation as a level shifter.
 At the individual level uncertainty enters the model through an idiosyncratic
 component of income risk, through a markovian process that models changes
 of household size over the lifecycle, and a location--specific preference
 shock, which is assumed identically and independently distributed across
 agents, regions and time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The job search process is modeled as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kennan2003effect"

\end_inset

.
 Individuals do not know the exact wage they will earn in the new location.
 The new wage is composed of a deterministic, and thus predictable, part
 and a component that is random.
 Over and above an expectation about some prevailing average level of wages
 the mover can expect in any given region at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, the actual job obtained after a move is an experience good and it is impossibl
e to be certain about the exact match quality ex ante.
 This setup gives rise to income risk associated with moving.

Individual Labor Income

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I model labor income as the product of a region specific price of human
 capital 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{dt}$
\end_inset

 with individual specific human capital 
\begin_inset Formula $q(i,t)$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_{idt} & = & w_{dt}q(i,t)\\
w_{dt} & = & \left(\overline{y}_{dt}\right)^{\eta_{d}}\\
q(i,t) & = & \exp(f(t)+z_{it})
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $f(t)$
\end_inset

 is a deterministic age effect and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{it}$
\end_inset

 stands for an individual specific persistent idiosyncratic shock.
 The coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{d}$
\end_inset

 allows for differential transmission of regional shocks into individual
 income by region 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the logarithm of labor income of individual 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 at age 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 residing in region 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, is defined as in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\ln y_{idt} & = & \eta_{d}\ln\overline{y}_{dt}+f(t)+z_{it}\nonumber \\
z_{it} & = & \rho z_{it-1}+e_{it-1}\nonumber \\
e & \sim & N(0,\sigma^{2})\label{eq:income-process}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The price of human capital 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{dt}$
\end_inset

 differs by region to reflect different industry compositions by region,
 which are taken as given.
 Underlying this is an assumption about non--equalizing factor prices across
 regions.
 It is plausible to think that within a single country, wages should tend
 to converge to a common level, particularly in the presence of large migratory
 flows from one region to the next.
 In assuming no relative factor price equality across US regions I rely
 on a host of evidence showing that relative wages vary considerably across
 regions over a long time horizon (see for example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_inset Formula $d$

, I assume that the timing is such that current period income is earned
 in the origin location 
\begin_inset Formula $d$

 The individual's next period income is then composed of the corresponding

\begin_inset Formula $f(t+1)$

.
 The individual--specific idiosyncratic component 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{it+1}$
\end_inset

 for a mover with 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{it}$
\end_inset

 is drawn from the conditional distribution 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{k\neq d}\equiv z_{ik}|z_{id},\,\forall k\neq d$
\end_inset

.
 This conditional distribution is assumed to be known to all agents, and
 it is allowed to differ from the conditional distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 for non-movers, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{k=d}\neq G_{k\neq d},\,\forall k\neq d$
\end_inset

.
 This setup allows for some uncertainty related to the quality of the match
 with a job in the new region 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, as mentioned above.
 The shape of 
\begin_inset Formula $G_{k\neq d}$
\end_inset

 determines the probability with which a mover with current value 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 can expect to draw a new value 
\begin_inset Formula $z'$
\end_inset

 after moving to 
\begin_inset Formula $k$

I assume the aggregate variables

 At date

 The VAR(1) process is defined in equation

\begin_inset Formula $A$

 is the variance-covariance matrix of the bivariate normal innovation 
\begin_inset Formula $\nu$

 Agents in the model have rational expectations which coincide with this
 model of aggregate price dynamics, i.e.
 when forecasting next period's aggregate state, they use the linear predictor
 implied by model

Mapping aggregate factors to regional prices

\begin_layout Standard
I assume that there is a deterministic mapping from the aggregate state
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{P}_{t}$
\end_inset

 into the price and income level of any region 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 which is known by all agents in the model.
 This means that once the aggregate state is known, agents know the price
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{dt}$
\end_inset

 and income level 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{y}_{dt}$
\end_inset

 in each region with certainty.
 The mapping is defined in terms of a linear function that depends on both
 aggregate states 
\begin_inset Formula $Y,P$
\end_inset

 and where the slope coefficients are region dependent, as shown in expression
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Similarly to the aggregate case,

Home Ownership Choice
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ownership choice is discrete, 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{t}\in\left\{ 0,1\right\} $
\end_inset

, and there is no quantity choice of housing.
 While renting, i.e.
 whenever 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{t}=0$
\end_inset

, individuals must pay rent which amounts to a constant fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{d}$
\end_inset

 of the current region-
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 house price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{d}$
\end_inset

.
 In order to buy, a proportion 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi p_{dt}$
\end_inset

 of the house value needs to be paid up front as a downpayment, while the
 remainder 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-\chi)p_{dt}$
\end_inset

 is financed by a standard fixed rate mortgage.
 In other words, only owners are allowed to borrow with their house as a
 collateral, and there is no unsecured debt.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Similar to the setup in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

assets
\begin_inset Quotes erd

\begin_inset Formula $a_{t}$

 and assume as a terminal condition that net wealth be non-negative by the
 last period of life in the model, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{T}+p_{dT}h_{T-1}\geq0$
\end_inset

, which translates into an implicit borrowing limit for owners.
 This implies that owners will choose a savings path contingent on the current
 price, their debt level, and their current age 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 such that they can satisfy this constraint in the final period.
 Furthermore, this setup does not require the owner to fulfil the downpayment
 (or margin) constraint in every period, but only in the period of purchase.
 This implies that when prices fall, owners do not have to adjust the size
 of their mortgage by remortgaging or selling the home, as long as the make
 the required interest payment.

Moving across locations is assumed to be costly in terms of utility.

 Moving costs differ between renters and owners.
 Moving for an owner requires to sell the house, which in turn requires
 some effort and time costs.
 This is on top of any other psychological costs incurred from moving states
 which are common between renters and owners.
 I specify the moving cost function as linear in parameters

Restrictions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moving is subject to a restriction regarding housing choices.
 I rule out the possibility of owning a home in region 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 while residing in region 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 This would apply for example for households who keep their home in 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, rent it out on the rental market, and purchase housing services either
 in rental or owner--occupied sector in the new region 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 I rule out this possibility because I observe very few movers in my sample
 doing this, presumably deterred by high management costs for letting agents
 and because of liquidity constraints, i.e.
 they need the money to buy a new place in the new region 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 I illustrate this in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 their current home right after a move.

 I make the standard assumption of additive separability between utility
 and idiosyncratic location shock 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 as well as the conditional independence assumption that says that the transitio
n of 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 is independent of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, I assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon\sim$
\end_inset

 EV Type 1.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The laws of motion for 
\begin_inset Formula $s,z$

 In each case, this is modeled by a transition matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\Gamma$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
z'|z & \sim & \Gamma_{z}\\
s'|s_{j} & \sim & \Gamma_{s,j}\\
\mathbf{P}'|\mathbf{P} & \sim & \Gamma_{\mathbf{P}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

In what follows I will use the expectations operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{E}_{z',s',\mathbf{P}'}\left[V|z,s,\mathbf{P}\right]$
\end_inset

 to abbreviate the implied tensor product multiplication used in obtaining
 the expected future value function.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is useful to define the conditional value function 
\begin_inset Formula $v\left(x,k\right)$
\end_inset

, which represents the optimal value after making housing and consumption
 choices at state 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $k$

\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$

 Notice that the value from each discrete choice is additively seperable
 in the conditional value 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 and the choice specific idiosyncratic shock 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 The conditional value function 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 represents the choices that have to be made conditional on being in a given
 location 
\begin_inset Formula $d$

 This formulation conveniently nests all discrete location choice configurations

\end_inset

 and moving from 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $k,\forall k\neq d$
\end_inset

 This expression shows the maximization problem faced by the consumer conditiona
l on choosing region 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, where consumption and housing need to be chosen subject to the constraints
 outlined just below.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 is a result of the distributional assumption on 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

, which admits a closed form expression of the expected value function,
 whereby 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\gamma}$
\end_inset

 is Euler's constant.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
V_{t}\left(x\right) & = & \max_{k\in D}\left\{ v_{t}(x,k)+\varepsilon_{ikt}\right\} \label{eq:V}\\

 & = & \overline{\gamma}+\ln\left(\sum_{k=1}^{J}\exp\left(v_{t}(x,k)\right)\right)\label{eq:vbar}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

Another convient by-product of the Type 1 EV assumption is that there is
 a closed form expression for the conditional choice probability of making
 a move from 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $k$

 when the state is

\begin_layout Standard
The period budget constraint for renters (i.e.
 individuals who enter the period with

 In case they buy at date 
\begin_inset Formula $t$

 Labor income is defined in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula $\overline{y}_{dt}$
\end_inset

 as introduced in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Individual-Labor-Income"

\end_inset

.
 Buyers can borrow against the value of their house and are required to
 make a proportional downpayment amounting to a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 of the value at purchase, while renters cannot borrow at all.
 This is embedded in constraint 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

, which states that if a renter chooses to buy, their next period assets
 must be greater or equal to the fraction of the purchase price that was
 financed via the mortgage, or non-negative otherwise.
 Constraint number 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:budget-interest"

 different interest applicable to savings as opposed to borrowing, both
 of which are taken as exogenous parameters in the model.
 The terminal condition constraint is in expression 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Owners.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For individuals entering the period as owners 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(h_{it-1}=1\right)$
\end_inset

, the budget constraint is similar except for two differences which relate
 to the borrowing constraint and transfers in case they sell the house.
 Owners are not required to make a scheduled mortgage payment -- a gradual
 reduction of debt, i.e.
 an increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, arises naturally from the terminal condition 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{iJ}+p_{J}h_{iJ-1}>0$
\end_inset

, as mentioned above.
 Therefore the budget of the owner is only affected by the house price in
 case they decide to sell the house, i.e.
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{it}=0$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, they obtain the purchase price net of the proportional selling
 cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

, plus they have to pay rent in 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, which is as already mentioned a fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{d}$
\end_inset

 of the prevailing house price.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of the borrowing constraint, I don't require the owner to comply
 with the downpayment constraint 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:budget-rent-downpay"

\end_inset

 in every period, as this would imply that a reduction in house price requires
 the owner to reduce the size of their mortgage, similarly to an investor
 who receives a margin call.
 Imposing this constraint in every period substantially decreases the amount
 of insurance against house price fluctuations provided by ownership and
 to which renters are exposed, thereby shutting down one important motivation
 to own in the model (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "sinai2005owner"

\end_inset

).
 Instead, owners are allowed to only make the interest payment on the mortgage,
 thus keep the balance constant, or borrow up to proportion 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-\chi)$
\end_inset

 of the current price as a buyer would, whichever amount is smaller (i.e.
 less positive).

The budget constraint for moving owners depends on the house price in both
 current and destination regions 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 since the house in the current region must be sold by assumption.
 The expression 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-\phi)p_{dt}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:budget-own-1"

\end_inset

 relates to proceeds from sale of the house in region 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, whereas the square brackets describe expenditures in region 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 Notice also that the borrowing constraint 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:budget-own-borrow-1"

\end_inset

 now is a function of the value of the new house in 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 It is important to note that this formulation precludes moving with negative
 equity if labor income is not enough to cover it.
 This is exacerbated in cases where the mover wants to buy immediately,
 since in that case the downpayment needs to be made as well, i.e.
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{idt}<a_{it}+(1-\phi)p_{dt}-\chi h_{it}p_{kt}$
\end_inset

 then the budget set is empty and the move is infeasible.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In my sample I observe 29 owners who move with negative equity (amounting
 to 3.4% of moving owners).
 78% of those do buy in the new location, the rest rent.
 I do not observe whether or not an owner defaults on the mortgage, which
 may be the action taken by this group of movers.
 Accounting for this subset of the population would require to 1) assume
 that they actually defaulted and 2) it would substantially increase the
 computational burden.
 For those reasons the model cannot account for this subset of the mover
 population at the moment.

Estimation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section I explain how the model is calibrated and estimated to fit
 some features of the data.
 There is a set of preset model parameters, the values of which I either
 take from other papers in the literature or I estimate them outside of
 the structural model and treat them as inputs.
 They are listed in table x.
 The remaining set of parameters are estimated using the simulated method
 of moments (SMM) approach, whereby given a set of parameters, the model
 is used to compute decision rules of agents, which in turn are used to
 simulate artificial data that should be close in some sense to the real
 data.
 The set of parameters to be estimated by SMM is 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=\left\{ \alpha_{0,\tau},\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},\alpha_{3},\alpha_{4},\gamma,\omega,\pi_{\tau},\xi(0),\xi(1)\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The objective function is the squared distance between the model moments
 and the corresponding data moments, each weighted by the variance in the
 data.
 In other words, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

 is the vector of variances of data moments, the weighting matrix of the
 SMM estimator is 
\begin_inset Formula $I\sigma^{2}$
\end_inset

To provide some evidence for the particular parametric form of the evolution
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 when moving across regions, it is useful to view 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{idt}$
\end_inset

 in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:income-process"

\end_inset

 as the residual from an ordinary least squares regression of log wages
 on time and region effects, as well as person specific demographic predictors.
 The question is whether individuals with a particularly high residual 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{idt}$
\end_inset

 are likely to have a high residual 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{ikt+1}$
\end_inset

 after their move to region 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, we want to investigate the joint distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(z_{idt},z_{ikt+1}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 In a first step I estimate the marginal distributions, which is just the
 cross-sectional distribution of both margins.
 Unsurprisingly, both margins are close to normal, which indicates a well-specif
ied regression model.
 The next step involves fitting the copula 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 via maximum likelihood to those data.
 The results indicate that there is a relatively high degree of dependence
 in the residual, with the estimated copula parameter of the order of 0.7.
 This estimate is in line with a simple correlation measure between 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{idt}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{ikt+1}$

I use an adapted version of the MCMC algorithm as devised by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "baragatti2013likelihood"

\end_inset

.
 In essence, this is a likelihood free estimator which employs what is called
 parallel tempering, i.e.
 several Monte Carlo chains that evolve in parallel and at different 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

temperatures
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (i.e.
 with different variances of the shock used to generate new parameter guesses).
 The key is that the chains are allowed to communicate at random times,
 such that if for example a hot (high variance) chain explored and area
 of the parameter space with relatively small function evaluations, cooler
 chains can jump to that region.
 This is an advantage in problems with multiple local optima and non-differentia
bilities, such as the one at hand.
 Furthermore, the parallel setup of the estimator lends itself almost naturally
 to large computer clusters, where each compute node is a chain.

Initial Conditions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The SIPP estimation sample runs from 1998 through 2012.
 The data moments the model is supposed to replicate are weighted averages
 over this period, where the weights are the SIPP sampling weights.
 When reconstructing an artificial sample from the model simulation, care
 must be taken to replicate the shocks experienced by each cohort in the
 data leading up to the point where they are observed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The data is subset to the ages allowed for in the model, i.e.
 20--50.
 I compute data moments, for example the average homeownership rate in region
 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, or the average total wealth of age group 40--45 in 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, as averages over the entire sample period:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\text{mean\_own\_data}_{d} & = & \frac{1}{15}\sum_{t=1998}^{2012}\left(\frac{1}{N_{dt}}\sum_{i\in d,t}^{N_{dt}}\omega_{it}\mathbf{1}\left[h_{it}=1\right]\right)\\
\text{mean\_wealth\_data\_40\_45}_{d} & = & \frac{1}{15}\sum_{t=1998}^{2012}\left(\frac{1}{N_{dt,j\in[40,45]}}\sum_{i\in d,t,j\in[40,45]}^{N_{dt,j\in[40,45]}}\omega_{it}w_{ijt}\right)
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{dt}$
\end_inset

 is the number of people in 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 at date 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{it}$
\end_inset

 is a person's crossectional weight, and 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in d,t$
\end_inset

 stands for 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is in 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 at date 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, 
\begin_inset Formula $i\in d,t,j\in[40,45]$
\end_inset

 stands for 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 is in 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 at date 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and age 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 in [40,45].
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This means that for the second data moment, for example, 40 year-olds from
 1998 contributed as well as 40 year-olds from the 2012 cohort.
 Needless to say, those cohorts faced a different sequence of house price
 shocks leading up the point of observation.
 For individuals 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

born
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 before the first data period, i.e.
 1998, I construct regional house price and regional income series going
 back until 1968.
 Simulating individuals from the 1968 cohort for a full lifetime of J=30
 years until the reach age 50 brings them into the year 1998, where they
 form the group of 50 year-olds in that particular year.
 This sort of staggered simulation is carried out until the final cohort
 is born in 2012 at age 20.
 No simulation needs to take place for any individual alive at years after
 2012.
 The initial distribution of assets is drawn from the empirical distribution
 of assets in the SIPP data.

Starting from the top of the table, the fit to average moving rates is very

 The average moving rates conditional on having children or on being an

 of moving with owning and moving with children.
 Next in line are coefficients from a linear regression model (prefixed

 The fit on the age coefficients is good.
