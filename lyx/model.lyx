\begin_layout Abstract
This paper estimates a lifecycle model of consumption, housing choice and
 migration in the presence of aggregate and regional shocks, using the Survey
 of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).
 Using the model I estimate the value of the migration option and the welfare
 impact of policies that may restrict mobility.
 The value of the option to move ranges from 0% up to almost 16% of lifetime
 consumption depending on the type of household considered.
 While I obtain an estimate of the elasticity of local population size with
 respect to a large regional shock which is close to estimates from the
 previous literature, I am able to show that the respective elasticities
 of outflows for renters and owners from that region are orders of magnitude
 apart.
 This has important implications for the design of housing and labour market
 policies.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Households are subject to many types of shocks, such as aggregate shocks,
 regional shocks and idiosyncratic shocks.
 As the recent crisis painfully reminds us, regional shocks to wages and
 house prices can be deep and prolonged.
 This paper develops and estimates a structural model with aggre- gate and
 regional shocks to wages and house prices in a life-cycle setting, in which
 households can insure against these shocks by migrating to another region,
 saving, and buying or renting a house.
 The model is estimated to match key moments from the Survey of Income and
 Program Participation (SIPP) related to mobility and homeownership across
 regions and by age.
 This framework helps evaluate the costs of regional shocks and the benefits
 of the various channels of self-insurance, thus also helps to inform policy
 reforms that affect the costs of these self-insurance mechanisms, including
 changing the costs of owning a house and moving.
 The estimated model implies that, while yearly mobility flows across regions
 are small, mobility is a very valuable option.
 In fact, were we to prevent the residents of a certain region from moving
 away, their expected lifetime utility falls by 5.1% and they would demand
 a 4.4% increase in period consumption for compensation.
 The model also finds that, were the mortgage interest-rate deduction eliminated
, the aggregate migration rate would increase only marginally by 0.1%.
 Using a general equilibrium correction, house prices are reduced by 5%,
 which results in a 1% increase in ownership.
 Redistribution of tax receipts towards poorer households and lower prices
 everywhere increase the incentives to exploit regional differences, which
 changes migration behaviour.
 Individuals value the elimination of the deduction by 2.4% of period consumption.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regional migration rates in the USA are relatively low despite the presence
 of large regional shocks.
 However, it would be a mistake to conclude from this observation that the
 option to migrate across regions has a small value to consumers.
 The goal of this paper is to provide a measure of having the option to
 migrate in the context of a lifecycle model with regional income and house
 price uncertainty, and I show that the value is large.
 To arrive at this measure, after fitting the model to micro data, I perform
 a counterfactual experiment whereby all migratory movement from a certain
 US region is prohibited, much like a country in a trade model that reverts
 to autarky.
 I then ask the question of how large of a compensation affected inviduals
 would demand in order to be indifferent between implementation and not
 of this policy.
 I can show that considering homeowners and renters separately in the model
 is of first order importance for answering this question, since they have
 very different elasticities of migration with respect to regional shocks.
 Providing new estimates for this elasticity by ownership status is a by-product
 of the main exercise, which is important for public policy in its own right.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regional shocks to labor demand and house prices may have profound and longlasti
ng impacts, as we are still witnessing in the aftermath of the 2007 fall
 in house prices and ensuing Great Recession.
 In this episode we have seen wide variation in the magnitude of local shocks
 despite underlying high national correlations.
 For example, the peak-to-trough decline in the Federal Housing Financing
 Agency (FHFA) house price index from 2007 to 2011 ranged from -2.3% in Pittsburg
h, to -61% in Las Vegas.

 The decline of the automobile industry in Detroit provides a vivid example
 of the effects of a permanent shock to labor income in a region: from the
 1950 to the 2010 censuses, the population of Detroit declined by 61%.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Shocks to regional labor demand affect renters and owners in a similar way,
 i.e.
 labor income of both falls.
 The effects of a fall in house prices is more nuanced, since renters stand
 to benefit from cheaper rent, if this is related to prices, and they may
 be able to purchase a now cheaper house, while owners may loose wealth
 invested in the house.
 For those reasons, we should expect to see different reactions in the mobility
 of renters and owners in response to different shocks.
 Labor market shocks should make both types more likely to leave the region,
 while price shocks could have differential impacts, depending on the relative
 importance of cheap rents, low value housing asset, and moving costs for
 renters and owners.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 2013, 63% of occupied housing units in the US were owned, while 37% were
 rented.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 At the same time, roughly 1.3% of the population migrate across US census
 division boundaries per year.
 Conditioning on ownership we find that 1.9% of renters and 0.67% owners move.
 A natural question is then to ask why do we observe owners moving less?
 All else equal, owners face higher moving costs, both in terms of financial
 as well as time and effort costs.
 Financial costs occur because of transaction costs in the housing market
 upon sale of the house (e.g.
 agency fees or transaction taxes), while costs of effort arise from owners
 having to spend time finding a suitable buyer, meet with agents and lawyers
 etc.
 A comparable renter is subject to those costs only to a lesser degree.
 Buying a house means to make a highly local financial investment, which
 is subject to shocks as discussed above, is relatively illiquid, and in
 addition may have a location specific flow of utility.
 Consumers may have preferences for locations.
 These factors interact to shape the joint decision of housing tenure, location
 choice, and mortgage borrowing.
 What is more, they all interact to influence the decision to move in response
 to a shock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the model I develop, there are several mechanisms which affect the home
 ownership choice of individuals.
 A downpayment requirement means that only individuals with sufficient cash
 on hand are able to buy a house at the current price.
 The model assumes a preference for owner-occupied accomodation and a local
 amenity, both of which influence the buying decision next to age, the probabili
ty of moving, and beliefs about future shocks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of the decision to migrate to another region, the model predicts
 that the likelihood of migration is increasing in the difference of discounted
 expected lifetime utilities between any two regions.
 Those relative utilities, in turn, depend among other things on the average
 regional income level and the level of regional house prices, both of which
 vary over time.
 Allowing regional characteristics to vary is a significant contribution
 to the literature on dynamic migration models such as for example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kennan2003effect"

\end_inset

, since it provides an fundamental reason for agents to move in response
 to a change in their economic environment, rather than as a result of idiosyncr
atic preference shocks alone.
 Including time-varying location characteristics, however, increases computation
al demands substantially.
 To keep those demands tractable, the model employs a factor structure which
 allows aggregate shocks to affect regions differently.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I estimate the model using a simulated method of moments estimator.
 I find that the model fits the data very well along the main dimensions
 of interest, which are mobility and ownership patterns over the lifecycle,
 ownership rates by region, migration flows across regions, as well as wealth
 accumulation over the lifecycle and by region.
 After fitting the model to the data, I first show how the model reacts
 to large regional shocks, I then estimate spatial labor supply elasticities
 for renters and owners separately before I move on to compute a measure
 of the value of the migration option.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I find that owners and renters face very different incentives in the model.
 The probability of moving conditional on being a renter is consistently
 higher than the one for owners, and it varies considerably with income
 and assets.
 The model can be used to quantify the moving cost in terms of dollars,
 and I find that the estimates for renters and owners bracket the moving
 cost obtained in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Migration is a low probability event in both data and model.
 Nevertheless, the welfare implications are large.
 I conduct an experiment whereby moving away from a certain region is prohibited.
 I compute the average lifetime utility of agents in the region under both
 scenarios, and I find that removing the option to move away from the region
 reduces lifetime utility by 1.22% on average.
 Conditioning on young versus old household, one finds a reduction of 3.66%
 for the former and 0.74% for the latter.
 In terms of compensating consumption that would achieve indifference for
 each of those groups, one would have to increase baseline consumption by
 2.2%, 5% and 1.5% for all residents, young residents and old residents, respectiv
ley.
 To properly understand these results it is important to keep in mind that
 I obtain estimates for the elasticity of labor supply with respect to a
 region-level income shock which vary significantly for renters and owners:
 I find an elasticity of 1.5 for renters and 0.18 for owners.
 Given that the ownership rate varies significantly by age, one can see
 that young, mobile renters are the group which incurs the greatest welfare
 loss from reduced mobility.
 The results further show the prominent role of expectations about future
 potential moves, which may not have to be realized in the end.
 People who are born in the treated region and never actually move incur
 the greatest loss of all from this curtailment of future actions.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Government policies might help to increase labor market efficiency, housing
 market inefficiency or both.
 The main inefficiencies any policy might target are incomplete asset markets,
 liquidity constraints, moving and transaction costs, income taxes and imperfect
 rental markets.
 One large pre-existing intervention in this context is the mortgage interest
 deduction.
 It is interesting to consider how abolishing this tax deduction might interact
 with borrowing, housing tenure choice and migration.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
I find that abolishing the mortgage interest deduction would have a only
 a negligible impact on the aggregate migration rate.
 At first sight one might be tempted to think that removing the deduction
 would result in more renters, which would mechanically translate into an
 increase in migration, since renters move more.
 The actual effect is more nuanced.
 First, because the mortgage tax deduction is a large scale policy, there
 is likely to be a general equilibrium effect.
 While my model is a partial equilibrium model, I can approximate the general
 equilibrium effect by assuming that the policy changes both taxes as well
 as prices.
 I use recent results from a stationary GE model by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "sommer2013implications"

\end_inset

 who find that house prices fall, while rents keep constant, after the policy
 is changed.
 Applying this price and rent correction to my model results in an increase
 in the ownership rate of roughly 1%, because more households are able to
 buy at lower prices.
 The net effect on migration is very small (0.1% of the baseline rate).
 The reduction in mobility is smaller than what we would expect from a pure
 change in composition towards more owners, because migration behaviour
 changes as well.
 Lower prices and a higher level of disposable income for the poor after
 redistribution of tax proceeds in all regions change the incentives to
 exploit regional differences with respect to the baseline.
 In terms of welfare, households prefer removing the deduction and would
 agree to giving up 2.4% of period consumption before being indifferent to
 the status quo.

My paper builds on 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, who are the first to develop a model of migration with multiple location
 choices over the lifecycle.
 Their main finding is that expected income is an important determinant
 of migration decisions, and their framework requires large moving costs
 to match observed migration decisions.
 The model features location-specific match effects in wages and amenity
 which are uncertain ex-ante, so the consumer has to move to a location
 in order to discover their values.
 The distributions of those match effects in each location are stationary.
 In their model, after having learned the value of the current location,
 the only reason for a move is a favourable realization of an i.i.d.
 preference shock which might occur in some future period ‚Äì there is no
 change in economic fundamentals which might encourage a move, like a shock
 to wages, for example.
 Relaxing this feature as well as adding housing and savings decisions are
 my main contributions to their paper.
 I am able to let regions experience differential income and price shocks
 over time, thereby providing an additional reason to move over and above
 idiosyncratic shocks.

 I follow

 the exact value of their new wage, over and above a predictable part, while
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 assumes that job offers arrive in the current location from a random alternativ
e location.
 My assumption implies firstly that individuals consider all potential locations
 in each period, and decide to move based on their expectations about how
 they will fare in each.
 Secondly it allows for reasons other than job offers to trigger a move,
 which is a feature of the data, as I will show below.

It is somewhat unfortunate that none of the datasets employed by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 None of them tracks movers, so it is impossible to know the circumstances
 of an individual at the moment they decided to move, which is ultimately
 of interest in this paper.

It is possible to construct a panel dataset from the CPS, but only with
 postal address as unit identifier.
 If an individual moves out, this can be inferred from the data, however,
 the destination of the move cannot ‚Äì in particular it is unknown whether
 they relocated withing the city, or somewhere else.
\end_layout

 I therefore use the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) in
 this paper, a longitudinal and nationally representative dataset.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before presenting statistics from SIPP data, I will explain the geographic
 concept I will be using in this paper, which is a US Census Division.
 Census Divisions are nine relatively large regions which separate the United
 States into groups of states

To a first approximation, those regions represent areas with a common housing
 and labor market.
 In the model, a move within any region is not considered as migration and
 therefore does not contribute to the overall migration rate.
 This implies that there is a proportion of moves across markets that do
 happen in the data, but which are not picked up by my geographic definition
 of a market.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aggregation of states into this particular grouping is but one of many
 possibilities, and I adopt this particular partition based on computational
 constraints.
 In many respects the ideal concept of a region is what economists would
 refer to as a local labor market, and metropolitan statistical areas (MSA)
 or commuting zones (CZ) come close to this.
 Unfortunately, for the purpose of the model in this paper, the so‚Äìdefined
 number of regions would be far too large to be computationally feasible.
 Hence the choice of census divisions.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The model presented below contains 25.4 million different points in the state
 space at which to solve a savings problem.
 Increasing the number of regions to 51 (to represent US states) increases
 this to 815 million points in the state space.
 Given that estimation requires evaluation of the model solution many times
 over, the former state space can be handled with code that is highly optimized
 for speed, while the latter cannot.

Descriptive Statistics on Cross Division Migration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I combine four panels of SIPP data (1996, 2001, 2004 and 2008) into a database
 with 102,529 individuals that I can follow over time and space.
 From this dataset, a couple of interesting facts emerge.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Annual-moving-rate"

\end_inset

 presents some summary annual moving rates for both state and Census Division
 level migration.
 The overall unconditional migration rate is 1.95% and 1.32% per year for
 cross state and cross division, respectively.
 The cross state figure differs from the 2% in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Migration-rates-Molloy"

\end_inset

 because I set up the SIPP data in terms of household heads, thereby missing
 some moves of non‚Äìreference persons, and potentially because of sample
 attrition.
 It is quite clear from table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Annual-moving-rate"

\end_inset

 that there is a marked distinction in the likelihood of moving across state
 as well as division boundaries between renters and owners, with 2.6% (1.85%)
 of renters versus 0.93% (0.7%) of owners moving across state (division) boundarie
s on average per year.
 In total I observe of 2684 cross Division moves made by 2329 unique individuals
, implying multiple moves for some movers, see table

 that there is a strongly declining age effect ‚Äì younger individuals move
 more.
 Both of those are highly salient features of the data, and they are the
 main dimension along which my model's performance is going to be evaluated.
 Finally, a summary regarding homeownership rates and median price to income

\begin_layout Paragraph
Determinants of Migration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The March Supplement to the Current Population Survey (CPS) contains several
 questions relevant for the study of migration.
 Here I analyse answers to the 2013 edition of the CPS to the question 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

What was the main reason for moving
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 where respondents are offered 19 options to choose from.
 The results are displayed in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:CPS-reason-move"

\end_inset

, and the caption to the table provides the key according to which I group
 the 19 options into four categories.
 It is striking to note that even though we are conditioning on moves across
 Division boundaries (and thus think of long-range moves), the percentage
 of people citing category 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

housing
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 as their main motivation is roughly 24% of the total population of movers.
 The table also disagreggates the response to the question by the distance
 between origin and destination state (not Division), and we can see that
 the proportion of respondents does vary with distance moved, but not to
 an extent that would suggest that housing becomes irrelevant as a motivation
 with increasing distance.
 Summing up in the bottom row of the table, we see that 55% say work was
 the main reason, 24% refer to housing and the remaining 21% is split between
 family and other reasons.
 The model to be presented below addresses each of these categories: Individuals
 can move out of work-related concerns (regional and individual level income
 fluctuations), because of housing considerations (regional house price
 fluctuation), for family reasons (stochastic age-dependent arrival of children)
 as well reasons classified as 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

other
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, which are accounted for by an idiosyncratic preference shock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:D2D-probit"

\end_inset

 I present estimates from a statistical analysis of the determinants of
 cross division moves from SIPP data, abstracting away from the severe endogenei
ty issues which the structural model below will account for.
 I regress a binary indicator for whether or not a cross division move took
 place in a given year on a set of explanatory variables which relate to
 the household in question in a probit regression.
 The table shows marginal effects computed at the sample mean of each variable,
 as well as the ratio of marginal effects to the baseline unconditional
 probability of moving (1.32%).
 The results indicate that there is a pronounced age effect, with each additiona
l year of age implying a reduction that is equal to 6% of the baseline probabili
ty.
 The same effect is found for whether or not children are present in the
 household.
 The effect of being a homeowner is very large and equivalent to a reduction
 in the propensity to move of 51% of the baseline probability.
 Increasing household income by $100,000 is equivalent to a 5% baseline
 baseline increase.
 Finally, having a college degree has an effect of equal magnitude than
 being a homeowner, but in the opposite direction: a college degree amounts
 to an increase of the baseline of 49%.
 According to this model, the effect of being a homeowner on the baseline
 moving probability is equal to an age increase of 8.3 years, thus taking
 a 30-year old to age 38; also, a household which owns the house would have
 to experience an increase in household income of $1m in order to make up
 for the implied loss in the probability of moving across divisions from
 being an owner.
 The house price to income ratio does not play a significant role in this
 specification.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Regional Income and House Price Risk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a final piece of motivation I present an overview of the variation in
 house price and average income at the division level.
 I mentioned above that the shocks to each region exhibit a strong correlation
 as well as a high degree of persistence.
 This is best to see using a plot of the time series of regional house price
 and average income indices and how they relate to the national average
 of that index.
 Figures 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Regional-House-Price-data"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Regional-Income-data"

\end_inset

 present the results of such an exercise.
 In both cases, we can see that nationwide shocks occur to varying degrees
 at the regional level; and that all series exhibit a high degree of persistence
, i.e.
 they are visibly different from an i.i.d.
 process.
 The model I will present now takes those patterns seriously and proposes
 a way to solve and estimate the resulting high-dimensional problem.

 Underlying this is an assumption about non‚Äìequalizing factor prices across
 regions.
 It is plausible to think that within a single country, wages should tend
 to converge to a common level, particularly in the presence of large migratory
 flows from one region to the next.
 In assuming no relative factor price equalization across US regions I rely
 on a host of evidence showing that relative wages vary considerably across
 regions over a long time horizon (see for example

\begin_inset Formula $d$

 This means that once the aggregate state is known, agents know the price
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{dt}$
\end_inset

 and income level 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{dt}$
\end_inset

 in each region with certainty.
 The mapping is defined in terms of a function that depends on both aggregate

One could say that the formulation is missing a shock, e.g.

 Adding such a shock would increase the state space by a factor equal to
 the number of integration nodes to be used for the approximation of the
 resulting integral, which is a big cost.
 I don't expect any major difference in my results.
 The fit of this approximation is very good, as will be shown further below.

Moving Costs.

Moving across locations is assumed to be costly in terms of utility.

\begin_inset Formula $x$

 Moving costs differ between renters and owners.
 Moving for an owner requires to sell the house, which in turn requires
 some effort and time costs.
 This is in addition to any other psychological costs incurred from moving
 states which are common between renters and owners.
 I specify the moving cost function as linear in parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta(d,x)=\alpha_{0,\tau}+\alpha_{1}j+\alpha_{2}j^{2}+\alpha_{3}h_{ij-1}+\alpha_{4}s_{ij}\label{eq:moving-cost}

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{1}$

The unobserved moving cost type 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau\in\{0,1\}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=1$

 indexes the high type, is a parsimonious way to account for the fact that
 in the data, some individuals never move.
 This is of particular relevance when thinking about owners, who may self‚Äìselect
 into ownership because they know they are unlikely to ever move.
 In the model this selection mechanism, together with any other factor that
 implies a high unobservable location preference, is collapsed into a type
 of person that has prohibitively high moving costs (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{0,\tau=1}$
\end_inset

 is large) and thus is unlikely to move.

\begin_inset Formula $k$

 In my sample I observe less than 1% of movers for which this appears to
 be true, most likely as a result of high managment fees or a binding liquidity
 constraint that forces them to sell the house to be able to afford the
 downpayment in the new region.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point an small remark about identification may be helpful in order
 to better understand some of the modelling choices so far.
 The moving cost function does not contain a term relating to distance of
 the move, which seems like a very intuitive thing to consider.
 This was not included because I could not find data moments that separately
 identify the cost of distance from the local amenity 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 So a model with a regional fixed effect 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{k}$
\end_inset

 is isopmorphic to one with an additional distance term in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta(d,x)$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, a different way to formalize the idea of the high moving cost
 type 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 would be to allow for a nested structure of preference shocks, and/or a
 random preference for the current location that creates a home‚Äìbias in
 the same way as 
\begin_inset Formula $\tau$
\end_inset

 does.
 Again, given that each of those represents a particular parametric assumption
 and we cannot use data to tell us which one is more relevant (at least
 in the context of this model), I regard those formulations as close to
 equivalent.

 Buyers can borrow against the value of their house and are required to

 of the value at purchase, while renters cannot borrow at all.
 This is embedded in constraint 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 must be greater or equal to the fraction of the purchase price that was

Owners.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For individuals entering the period as owners 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(h_{ij-1}=1\right)$
\end_inset

, the budget constraint is similar except for two differences which relate
 to the borrowing constraint and transfers in case they sell the house.
 Owners are not required to make a scheduled mortgage payment ‚Äì a gradual
 reduction of debt, i.e.
 an increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, arises naturally from the terminal condition 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{iJ}+p_{t}h_{iJ-1}\geq0,\forall t$
\end_inset

, as mentioned above.
 Therefore the budget of the owner is only affected by the house price in
 case they decide to sell the house, i.e.
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{ij}=0$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, they obtain the house price net of the proportional selling
 cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

, plus they have to pay rent in region 
\begin_inset Formula $d$

Owners.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The budget constraint for moving owners depends on the house price in both
 current and destination regions 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 since the house in the current region must be sold by assumption.
 The expression 
\begin_inset Formula $(1-\phi)p_{dt}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:budget-own-1"

\end_inset

 relates to proceeds from sale of the house in region 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, whereas the square brackets describe expenditures in region 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 Notice also that the borrowing constraint 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:budget-own-borrow-1"

\end_inset

 now is a function of the value of the new house in 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 It is important to note that this formulation precludes moving with negative
 equity if labor income is not enough to cover it.
 This is exacerbated in cases where the mover wants to buy immediately in
 the new region, since in that case the downpayment needs to be made as
 well, i.e.
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{ijdt}<a_{ij}+(1-\phi)p_{dt}-\chi h_{ij}p_{kt}$
\end_inset

 then the budget set is empty and moving and buying is infeasible.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In my sample I observe 29 owners who move with negative equity (amounting
 to 3.4% of moving owners).
 78% of those do buy in the new location, the rest rent.
 I do not observe whether or not an owner defaults on the mortgage.
 Accounting for this subset of the population would require to 1) assume
 that they actually defaulted and 2) it would substantially increase the
 computational burden.
 For those reasons the model cannot account for this subset of the mover
 population at the moment.

Solving and Simulating the Model

\begin_layout Standard
The model described above is a typical application of a mixed discrete‚Äìcontinuou
s choice problem.
 In the next section I will introduce a nested fixed point estimator, which
 requires repeated evaluation of the model solution at each parameter guess,
 thus placing a binding time-contraint on time each solution may take.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The consumption/savings problem to be solved at each state, and its combination
 with multiple discrete choices and borrowing constraints, introduces several
 non-differentiabilities in the asset dimension of the value function.
 This makes using fast first order condition‚Äìbased approaches to solve the
 consumption problem more difficult.

 I found my problem not easily amenable to their solution, and focused on

 one not subject to potential local minima to the savings problem).
 In particular, the method described in

I solve the model in a backward-recursive way, starting at maximal age 50
 and going back until initial age 20.
 In the final period the known value is computed at all relevant states.
 From period 
\begin_inset Formula $J-1$
\end_inset

 onwards, the algorithm in each period iterates over all state variables
 and computes a solution to the savings problem at each combination of state
 and discrete choices variables (including housing and location choices).
 Notice that this state space spans all values for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}_{t}$
\end_inset

 observed over the sample period.
 After this solution is obtained at a certain state, the discrete housing
 choice is computed, after which each conditional value function 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 is known.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the solution is obtained, simulation of the model proceeds by using

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{F}_{t}$

 as well as their regional dependants 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(q_{dt},p_{dt}\right)$
\end_inset

 to obtain simulated lifecycle data.
 As I will explain in greater detail in the next section, this proceedure
 needs to replicate the time and age structure found in the data, which
 is achieved by simulating different cohorts, starting life in 1967 and
 all successive years up until 2012.
 The model moments are then computed using the empirical age distribution
 found in the estimation sample as sampling weights.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Estimation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section I explain how the model is estimated to fit some features
 of the data.
 There is a set of preset model parameters, the values of which I either
 take from other papers in the literature or I estimate them outside of
 the structural model and treat them as inputs.
 The remaining set of parameters are estimated using the simulated method
 of moments (SMM) approach, whereby given a set of parameters, the model
 is used to compute decision rules of agents, which in turn are used to
 simulate artificial data.
 A set of summarizing features from the artificial data should then be close
 to the same features of the the real data.
 I will first discuss estimation of the exogenous stochastic processes,
 and then turn to the estimation of the model preference parameters.

A copula is a multivariate probability distribution function which connects
 univariate margins by taking into account the underlying dependence structure.
 For example, a finite state Markov transition matrix is a nonparametric
 approximation to a bivariate copula, and they converge as the number of
 states goes to infinity, see

The proceedure relies crucially on the assumption that individuals have
 to move to the new region before they can discover 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{t+1}$
\end_inset

 One could account for apotential selection effect on 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{t}$

 by moving estimation of this part into the structural model and jointly
 estimate behavioural and wage related parameters.
 The model provides a set of exclusion restrictions that would allow to
 do this in theory.
 Identification of a potential selection effect may be difficult, however,
 because the sample of movers is relatively small.

 Averaging over years was necessary to preserve a reasonable sample size
 in all conditioning cells.
 However, it also introduces an initial conditions and cohort effects problem,
 since, for example, a 30-year-old in 1997 faced a different economic environmen
t over their lifecycle than a similar 30-year-old in 2012 would have.
 The challenge is to construct an artificial dataset from simulated data,
 which has the same time and age structure as the sample taken from the
 data ‚Äì in particular, agents in the model should have faced the same sequence
 of aggregate shocks as their data counterparts from the estimation sample.
 This requires to simulate individuals starting in different calendar years,
 taking into account the actual observed time series for regional house
 prices and incomes.
 I describe the proceedure in detail in the appendix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Additional to SIPP data, the moment vector contains three statistics from

Identification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Identification is achieved by comparing household behaviour under different
 price regimes.
 The variation comes from using the observed house price and labor productivity
 series in estimation, which vary over time and by region.
 The identifying assumption is that, conditional on all other model features,
 households must be statistically identical across those differing price
 regimes.
 In particular, this requires that household preferences be stable over
 time and do not vary by region.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The model is not non-parametrically identified; Both variation in prices
 and further restrictions such as functional form are needed, because price
 variation is at the regional (and not household-) level.

\begin_inset Formula $m(\theta)$
\end_inset

 respond to a change in 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$

.
 However it is possible to use graphical analysis to show how some moments
 relate more strongly to certain parameters than others.

Regarding parameters of the moving cost function, parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{0,\tau=0},\alpha_{3},\alpha_{4}$
\end_inset

 represent the intercept for low moving cost types, the coefficent on ownership
 and the effect of household size on moving costs, respectivley.
 They are related to, in order, the average moving rate 
\begin_inset Formula $E[\text{move}]$
\end_inset

, the moving rate conditional on owning 
\begin_inset Formula $E[\text{move}|h_{t}=1]$
\end_inset

, and the moving rate conditional on household size 
\begin_inset Formula $E[\text{move}|s_{t}=1]$
\end_inset

.
 The age effects 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}$
\end_inset

 are related to the age‚Äìcoefficients of the auxiliary model for moving,
 defined in expression 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:auxmod-move"

\end_inset

, as well as the the average proportion of movers in the last period of
 life 
\begin_inset Formula $E[\text{move}|T]$
\end_inset

.
 The relationship between mobility and ownership, as well as mobility and
 household size are also captured by the covariances 
\begin_inset Formula $Cov(\text{move},h)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Cov(\text{move},s)$
\end_inset

, both of which are again related to the moving cost parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{3}$

\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{4}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The proportion of high moving cost types 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{\tau}$
\end_inset

 is related to the data moments concering the number of moves per person,

\begin_inset Formula $E[\text{moved never}]$
\end_inset

.
 The other two moments on the frequency of moves, 
\begin_inset Formula $E[\text{moved once}]$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $E[\text{moved twice+}]$
\end_inset

 help to identify all moving cost parameters.

\begin_layout Standard
Given that the house price processes in each region are exogenous to the
 model, the parameters measuring utility from ownership, 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{1},\xi_{2}$

 region and by household size, the covariance of owning with household size,
 and the age‚Äìprofile parameters from the auxiliary model of ownership in

\begin_layout Subsection
Parameter Estimates and Moments 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model fits the data moments fairly well overall.
 The moment vector 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 contains conditional means and covariances, which are largely self-explanatory.
 I introduce two auxiliary models inluded in 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 which relate to the age profiles of both migration and ownership.
 Both models are linear probability models, where the dependent variable
 is either ownership status at the beginning of the period, 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{it-1}$
\end_inset

, or whether a move took place, denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{move}_{it}=\mathbf{1}\left[d_{it}\neq d'_{it}\right]$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
h_{it} & = & \beta_{0,h}+\beta_{1,h}t_{it}+\beta_{2,h}t_{it}^{2}+u_{h,it}\label{eq:auxmod-h}\\
\text{move}_{it} & = & \beta_{0,m}+\beta_{1,m}t_{it}+\beta_{2,m}t_{it}^{2}+u_{m,it}\label{eq:auxmod-move}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

The fit is displayed in tables 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:fit-model-and-data"

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:fit-model-and-data-flows"

\end_inset

.
 The upper panel of 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:fit-model-and-data"

\end_inset

 shows moments related to mobility, the lower panel shows moments related
 to homeownership.
 Regarding mobility, the fit is very good.
 The only statistic slightly out of line is the frequency distribution of
 moves per mover.
 There is no mechanism in the model that could generate the observed pattern
 in the data.
 One possibility would be to augment the set of moving cost types with a
 third type that has an even lower moving cost.
 The estimates for the auxiliary model defined in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:auxmod-move"

\end_inset

 representing the age profile in ownership also provide a good fit to the
 data.
 Looking at table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:fit-model-and-data-flows"

\end_inset

 we see that the average flows into each region are reasonably close to
 the data.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moving on to moments related to ownership, we see that the unconditional
 mean of ownership is identical to the data moment.
 Condition by region provides a more varied picture, with some regions overestim
ated and others underestimated.
 The reason for this is that there is heterogeneity in ownership rates by
 region which is not easily accounted for by the fundamentals of regional
 house price and mean income alone.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
There is large degree of house price heterogeneity at the local level with
 is not in the model but which contributes to the average ownership rate
 at the regional level.
 Local building regulations, rent control or certain topographical features
 all influence the actual house price that the local level; The price index
 used in the model incurs some unavoidable aggregation error in this respect,
 and the same holds for my estimate of the average rent to price ratio.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Remember that by taking prices and incomes as given, the model is restricted
 to only few levers that affect the homeownership rate.
 The main parameters in this respect are the utility premia 
\begin_inset Formula $\xi_{1},\xi_{2}$
\end_inset

 and the weight in the final period utility 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

.
 The model at the moment overpredicts ownership in later periods of life.
 This is visible from the intercept of the auxiliary model 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:auxmod-h"

\end_inset

, which relates the ownership rate to an age profile.
 The reason for this is that in a model where age and wealth are the main
 dimensions of variation across households, as soon as a certain wealth
 threshold is crossed, all agents become owners.
 In other words, the model cannot account for wealthy houeholds who prefer
 not to own.
 One way to improve in this dimension would be to introduce different types
 of housing preferences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given that the CRRA coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma$
\end_inset

 is taken as fixed in the current implementation of the model, the moments
 relating to wealth resulting from the model can be viewed as some form
 of model validation.
 The model moments in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:fit-model-nontarget"

\end_inset

 by the estimation algorithm.
 Despite this, they are very close the data counterparts.

 more pleasant to look, and I present this in figures

I will now move on to describe the results of this paper.
 I will first investigate moving costs, then estimate migration elasticities
 with respect to regional shocks to frame the main result, which is the
 value of the migration option.

The role of moving costs 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moving costs in the model are measured in terms of utility.
 I convert them to dollar values by finding the amount of compensating assets
 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{*}$
\end_inset

 which would make an individual at state 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 indifferent between the value of moving with costs 
\begin_inset Formula $(v)$
\end_inset

 (but extra assets) and without 
\begin_inset Formula $(\tilde{v})$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, dollar‚Äìvalued moving costs are measured by 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{*}$
\end_inset

 which solves

\emph default

\begin_inset Formula $x$

\emph on

\end_layout

\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

The measure is taken at a state

\begin_layout Standard
Similarly to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

, the moving costs are large.
 As they explain, this is because

There are several reasons for why owners move less than renters.
 First, they have higher moving costs as implied by a positive estimate
 for parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 Second, owners pay a transaction cost each time they sell the house (proportion
al cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$
\end_inset

), which affects the value of migration.
 Third, owners have to comply with the downpayment constraint if they wish
 to buy in the new region, which puts restrictions on the consumption paths
 of movers.
 Finally, ownership is correlated with larger household size 
\begin_inset Formula $(s=1)$
\end_inset

, which itself carries a higher moving cost 
\begin_inset Formula $(\alpha_{4})$
\end_inset

.

 I sequentially remove estimated frictions from owner mobility to uncover
 the relative importance of each component.
 Ownership increases as we successively remove frictions along the first
 row of the table, as expected: owning becomes less costly in terms of both
 money and utility.
 The second row shows that the average migration rate increases more strongly
 if we remove the owner's moving cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{3}$

 rather than the fixed cost of selling

\begin_layout Subsection
Labor Supply Elasticity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section I illustrate how the model reacts to large economic shocks
 at the regional level.
 The overall aim is to provide an estimate for the elasticity of labor supply
 when individuals have the choice between renting and owning, and regional
 prices are risky.
 The regional shock consists of reducing the level of the observed mean
 income series by 10% in the West North Central division only (West North
 Central (WNC) has region index 
\begin_inset Formula $d=8$
\end_inset

).
 Regional income and house price shocks are correlated, and I measure this
 correlation with an estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\Omega_{d}$
\end_inset

 obtained in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:VAR-process-1"

\end_inset

.
 This correlation translates the income shock into a -6% shock for house
 prices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment is conducted under the assumption that agents did not foresee
 the shock and therefore are surprised in the year 2000 to find that the
 mapping form aggregate factors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(Q,P\right)$
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(q_{8},p_{8}\right)$
\end_inset

 as defined in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:VAR-reg-determ"

\end_inset

 does not apply anymore.
 In terms of their beliefs about aggregate and regional prices, instead
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[q_{8,2000},p_{8,2000}\right]'=\mathbf{a}_{8}\mathbf{F}_{2000}$
\end_inset

 as expected, they observe 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[0.9q_{8,2000},0.94p_{8,2000}\right]'=\mathbf{a}'_{8}\mathbf{F}_{2000}$
\end_inset

.
 They realize that the coefficients in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{8}$
\end_inset

 have changed to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}'_{8}$
\end_inset

 and they use this new set of coefficients to derive prices in region 
\begin_inset Formula $d=8$
\end_inset

 from then on, ie.
 the shock is permanent thereafter.

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 illustrates the experiment.
 Starting with the bottom 2 panels, we see how the shock is implemented.
 A 10% drop in regional labor income is accompanied by a 6% reduction in
 the level of house prices.
 It is a priori unclear what aggregate response in mobility to expect from
 such a shock: in the end, renters benefit from lower house prices, both
 because of smaller expenses and because of a relaxation of their downpayment
 constraint.
 Hence, for renters WNC might become more rather than less attractive after
 the shock.
 In terms of cash on hand, the result is going to depend on the expenditure
 share of housing in household income.
 Also, renters and owners have different mobility costs, and they may value
 differently changes to prices and how those affect their future wealth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under the current parameterization of the model, the reduction in labor
 income has a larger effect than the cheaper price of rent, resulting in
 an overall increase in outflows from the region, as can be seen in the
 first panel of figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:ypshock-experiment"

\end_inset

, which depicts outflows as a proportion of local population, and the shock
 shifts outflows up by 0.2 percentage points on average.
 It is interesting to compare this result to the elasticity obtained in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kennan2003effect"

\end_inset

, where a similar 10% shock is applied to income in a region, resulting
 in an elasticity of total poluation of 0.5.
 I find in the present model an elasticity of total population which is
 0.4.
 Looking at the elasticity of the outflow rate, however, I find 1.53 for
 renters, and 0.18 for owners.
 This large difference in outflow elasticities illustrates the important
 difference between renters and owners when thinking about mobility as a
 reponse to shocks.

It is important to emphasize that this comparison is far from ideal and
 I don't want this to be misunderstood.
 There is a conceptual difference, and a practical one.
 Conceptually,

\end_inset

 iterate on the model-implied transition matrix of moves to generate a new
 steady state equilibium; Instead, I alter the observed series of regional
 prices in the described fashion and resimulate the model once.
 Both exercises measure changes between 2 equilibria, but my model takes
 prices and incomes as given from the data (house prices don't exist in
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, and local wage distributions are stationary and iid from the point of
 view of a mover).
 As a practical matter, I take the average over changes 
\emph on
in each period
\emph default
, while they focus on the new equilibrium after convergence (roughly 15
 years).

\begin_layout Subsection
The value of Migration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section presents a measure of how much individuals care about having
 the option to migrate across regions.
 The question is motivated by relatively low migratory flows across regions,
 1.32% of households per year, as initially stated.
 Do low flows imply low value? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I attempt to answer this question with a counterfactual experiment whereby
 the situation of West North Central is changed in the sense that immigration
 is allowed, but emigrating from there is prohibited.
 I will call this policy the 
\emph on
no-move 
\emph default
policy.
 The question is: Who is most affected by this restriction, young, old,
 people who did in fact move and cannot now or the ones who did not move
 to start with? First we will discuss changes in migration flows, and the
 welfare effects for residents of WNC under both scenarios, and by whether
 they are classified as 
\emph on
young 
\emph default
or 
\emph on
old
\emph default
.
 Finally, we will analyze the experience of individuals who would have moved
 in the baseline environment, but are now prevented from doing so.
 In all of the following experiments, individuals experience the same sequences
 of random shocks in each simulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Migration flows and are displayed in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:value-of-migration-flows"

\end_inset

.
 The top panel shows changes in immigration flows to the region for both
 scenarios, and the respective percentage change.
 Comparing the first two columns as percentage changes in column three,
 we see that inflows into the region fall dramatically in a world where
 moving away from WNC is not an option.
 This shows that agents outside of the region perceive WNC as a much inferior
 option to the baseline.
 The lower panel of the table shows baseline emmigration flows for comparison.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:value-of-migration-utility"

\end_inset

 contains the main results.
 All columns display percentage differences between 
\emph on
no-move 
\emph default
and baseline.
 The first three columns give a general overview of people who resided some
 time in the region, whereas the last two columns focus on people born in
 WNC.
 Starting with the first column, we see that looking at all one-time residents,
 average realized lifetime utility 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 (this is object 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:V"

\end_inset

) decreases by 1.22%.
 Considering only flow payoffs (i.e.
 object 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:utility"

\end_inset

), we see that 
\begin_inset Formula $u$
\end_inset

 decreases by almost 6% on average.
 The difference between 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta u$
\end_inset

 is informative about the tradeoff between period utility and how the policy
 is reflected in future values.
 Given that in this instance the ownership rate rises by 8% as emigration
 is shut down, given that owning gives extra utility and it occurs later
 in life, it is easy to see why future expected values decrease less than
 flow payoffs.
 The value of savings and mortgages falls by roughly 33%.
 Taken together, all of this implies that the average person who lived at
 least some time in WNC would demand a 2.17% proportional increase in consumption
 in order to be indifferent between both scenarios.

\end_inset

 These numbers clearly confound many things (the policy changes the composition
 of residents who move to WNC), but they give a global overview of how individua
ls in the entire economy are affected, who considered staying or moving
 there an optimal choice in the baseline.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second column splits the analysis by age and considers people below
 and above mean age in the region, labelled 
\emph on
young 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
old 
\emph default
respectively.
 The purpose of this is to see which part of the lifecycle is particularly
 affected by the policy.
 The young section of the simulated lifes bears the brunt of the loss in
 utility, suffering a 3.66% reduction in average lifetime value for young
 ages vs a 0.74% reduction when older.
 This is an intuitive result, since it is the young population that has
 to forgoe a greater number of profitable opportunities of moving away.
 Ownership increases again, which is largely a result of WNC being a region
 with relatively low house price level.
 The implied consumption subsidies are 5% for young and 1.45% for old.
\begin_inset Foot

\emph on

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the last two columns show the experience of people who were born
 in WNC as a mover type (
\begin_inset Formula $\tau=0$
\end_inset

), and either moved away in the baseline, or not.
 It turns out that in terms of lifetime utility 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 those who moved away are almost equally well off in both scenarios.
 Among the explaining factors for this result is the avoidance of the moving
 cost, and the potentially slower entry into homeownership after a move.
 The average lifetime experience being slightly better when they cannot
 move, the original movers would be happy to accept 1.3% lower consumption
 to be able to participate in the 
\emph on
no-move 
\emph default
policy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Quite differently for people who were born in WNC and stayed there for their
 entire life, see the final column of table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:value-of-migration-utility"

\end_inset

.
 Even though their arrangement of state variables and shocks never lead
 to an 
\emph on
actual 
\emph default
move, they greatly suffer from the reduced prospect of potentially ever
 being able to make such a move in the future.
 This is clearly visible from the difference in 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta u$
\end_inset

 for this group.
 They have slightly higher period utility because more of them decide to
 become homeowners now that the future option of migration has been removed,
 and this is reflected in larger mortgage debts and slightly greater wealth
 averages.

 Numerically, this reduction may be indistinguishable from zero (e.g.

 strongly on how the treated region compares with others in terms of amenities,
 average price and incomes, which in turn will determine the asset position

Abolishing the Mortgage Interest Deduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In this section I investigate the impact of abolishing the mortgage interest
 deduction on migration and ownership rates.
 In the United States, homeowners are allowed to deduct the interest paid
 on the mortgage for their primary residence from taxable income.

It is often held that if there were an offsetting taxation of imputed rent
 which owner-occupiers pay to themselves in place, the negative aspects
 of the subsidy could be greatly reduced.
 Implementing such taxes is politically difficult in most circumstances,
 probably highlighted by the small number of nations which have adopted
 some form of this tax.

 The common wisdom is that it distorts the housing market by subsidizing
 owners, thereby leading to a higher rate of ownership as would arise without
 the subsidy.
 As discussed at length above, owners are less mobile than renters, so the
 question investigated in this subsection is whether abolishing the mortgage
 interest deduction would increase mobility, and if so, by how much.
 The answer to this question provides some guidance on whether housing policy
 could serve as an effective means to enhance the efficiency of the labor
 market by fostering greater mobility, or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
At this point it is important to emphasize that depending on the elasticity
 of housing supply in a given market, we expect to see a general equilibrium
 effect of house prices in response to the policy change.
 The subsidy implied by the interest deduction can be viewed much like a
 characteristic of the house, like for instance distance to schools, or
 access to transportation networks.
 As such, it is capitalized into house price.
 Therefore, removing the subsidy would change long-run equilibrium prices,
 in the same way as moving a certain property to a location with a different
 set of available amenities would change its value.
 In order to partially accomodate this effect, I will refer to the recent
 paper by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "sommer2013implications"

\end_inset

, in which the authors compute the stationary general equilibrium in a model
 with infinitely lived, heterogeneous agents who are either renters, owner-occup
iers or owner-landlords.
 They compute equilibrium prices and rents arising from different assumption
 about the tax system.
 They find that house prices decrease on the order of 5% when the mortgage
 interest deduction is abolished, with rents keeping roughly constant and
 the homeownership rate increasing from 65% to 71%.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The mechanism is as follows: removing the subsidy lowers the equilibrium
 house price, since this is no longer capitalized into the value of the
 house; lower house prices makes housing affordable to more low wealth people
 who couldn't buy before, thereby increasing the ownership rate.
 Their model does not feature multiple labor or housing markets, and resting
 on the stationary equilibrium concept it does not allow for variation in
 house prices over time as is the case here; nevertheless, using their result
 to adjust the level of house prices by 5% in all locations when removing
 the mortgage deduction seems like a worthwhile exercise to at least approximate
 a potential general equilibrium effect in my model.

 The model being in after tax terms, it does not feature a formal tax system

 In reality the interest rate deduction reduces taxable income, thereby
 increasing disposable income of owners.
 Therefore, to simulate the removal of the deduction, I reduce disposable
 income of owners by an amount equivalent to their average implied tax savings.
 To do this I use data from

To provide some guidance, it is useful to start with a simple calculation
 to gauge the likely effect of the policy change on migration rates under
 the assumption that the conditional choice probabilities (i.e.
 whether to move or not) in the model do not change.
 This is equivalent to saying that there is a pure composition effect, but
 no effect on behaviour.
 To simplify the example, let's assume that the baseline ownership rate
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{o}=0.63$
\end_inset

, and that the annual migration rates for owners and renters are given by
 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{o}=0.7$
\end_inset

% and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{r}=2\%$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 This would give rise to a baseline unconditional migration rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{o}m_{o}+(1-\pi_{o})m_{r}=1.81\%$
\end_inset

.
 Assuming that the conditional choice probabilities which give rise to 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{o}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{r}$
\end_inset

 do not change due to the policy change, and assume, for example, that removing
 the subsidy increases the ownership rate by 1% such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{o}'=0.64$
\end_inset

.
 In that case we would expect to see a new migration rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{o}'m_{o}+(1-\pi_{o}')m_{r}=1.68\%$
\end_inset

, implying a decrease in the migration rate of 0.013 percentage points (or
 a 35% reduction of the rate).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The choice probabilities do change after the policy is implemented.
 In fact, it is easy to show that the only case under which the relative
 moving probabilities would remain constant is the one where the relative
 lifetime utilities in each region would change by exactly the same amount.
 This is not very likely to happen.
 Remember that the value in any location is determined by the utility derived
 from owning (enters utility directly), by the level of house prices, and
 by the level of consumption.
 Given a vector of house prices and incomes in the baseline environment,
 we can determine the relative differences in utilities and the corresponding
 probabilities of moving.
 Removing the mortgage deduction affects the price vector.
 Furthermore, by redistributing tax receipts we increase disposable income
 of a set of the population that was not able to buy before ‚Äì not in their
 current region, and possibly not in another region.
 The overall effect on the migration rate will therefore be composed of
 a composition effect (shifting individuals from renter to owner status
 or vice versa), and an effect that arises from changes in behaviour, influenced
 by different price levels, different price to rent ratios, and redistribution
 of tax receipts from previous owners to the entire population.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The results are listed in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:Abolishing-the-mortgage"

\end_inset

, and the columns under the subheading 
\emph on
Remove Deduction 
\emph default
show the results of the experiment with and without the GE correction.
 Both cases redistribute the taxes saved by removing the deduction on a
 per capita, per period basis.
 In other words, for total tax revenue 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 individuals observed for 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 periods, each individual receives 
\begin_inset Formula $X/(TN)$
\end_inset

 additional dollars per period.
 This scheme approximates a reduction in income taxes financed by the removal
 of the mortgage deduction.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In the column without the GE correction, we see that ownership decreases
 by roughly 0.8%.
 This is a result of some marginal buyers being unable to satisfy the downpaymen
t without the deduction.
 The migration rate increase only marginally despite this, because the change
 in composition towards more renters is offset to some degree by harder
 access to ownership in all regions without the benefits of the deduction.
 This reduces the incentives to move for some households who would have
 bought in different regions before.
 In terms of welfare effects, agents are close to indifferent between this
 policy and the baseline.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
As a metric of welfare I compute the implicit consumption tax 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

 which would make agents indifferent in terms of expected lifetime utility

\end_layout

\end_inset

 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The final column shows the results with the GE correction, which lowers
 house prices by 5% in all regions, while keeping rents at a constant level.
 Keeping rents constant is achieved by changing the price to rent ratios
 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa_{d}$
\end_inset

 in proportion to the reduction in prices.
 We find that ownership increases by about 1.3% as a result of lower house
 prices.
 The reverse mechanism to the previous paragraph is at work, implying that
 more people can buy, in this case despite the removal of the subsidy to
 owners.
 The change in composition towards more owners combined with access to housing
 in more regions produces a net effect on migration that is slightly positive
 at 0.115% of the baseline rate.
 The welfare implications for this experiment are larger than in the previous
 case and amount to 2.4% of per period consumption over the lifecycle.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
In concluding this section, it is instructive to note the importance of
 the general equilibrium effect in this case.
 Under the assumption of constant prices, the effect of removing the deduction
 is that ownership is reduced and that migration slightly increases.
 Removing the deduction means fewer low wealth housholds can buy housing,
 which reduces welfare, and this offsets any gains made form slightly more
 migration.
 Taking the price change and the implications for the price to rent ratio
 into account, however, shows that ownership would increase.
 This would affect the migration rate only marginally, but have a significant
 impact on welfare.

\begin_layout Section
Conclusion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main result of this paper is to show that despite average migration
 rates being low, the option value associated with the possibility to leave
 a location in a world with regional shocks to house prices and labor income
 is large.
 Removing the option to leave a certain region in the model implies an associate
d reduction in lifetime utility that ranges from 0% up to almost 16% depending
 on the type of household one considers.
 To arrive at this result, I construct a lifecycle model which includes
 homeownership as a choice variable next to savings and location choices,
 which I then fit to SIPP data and use to make counterfactual experiments.
 Considering homeownership is motivated by the fact that well over 60% of
 the US population are owners, and the observation that owners exhibit vastly
 different migratory behaviour than renters.
 The model places particular emphasis on a close representation of the observed
 house price and income series, both of which exhibit strong correlation
 of regional shocks.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model delivers an estimate of the elasticity of local population size
 with respect to a large regional income shock that is in line with the
 previous literature.
 The new finding here, however, is that the elasticity of outflows differs
 greatly between owners and renters.
 It is important for policy makers to keep in mind the very low mobility
 of owners when thinking about how households could offset large shocks.
 Subsidies to homeownership like the mortgage interest deduction are examples
 of policies which greatly affect the aggregate elasticity of mobility w.r.t.
 to regional shocks by increasing the share of owners.
 A thorough investigation of issues like this requires an equilibrium model
 for house prices, however, so is left for future research.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 to produce a proportionally different moving cost.
 In the first experiment, moving costs are reduced to half their level,
 i.e.

, i.e.
 halfing the moving cost.
 Renters average mobility jumps to 16% of the population changing locations

 Accordingly the ownership rate drops to 42%.
 The policy is very valuable in terms of welfare, with

 consumption if they were allowed to switch to

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We see the opposite kind of effects if we perform the policy in the other

 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

 shows the results of this experiment, and we see that mobility of both
 renters and owners is reduced by a factor of 10.
 The homeownership rate increases, since some individuals who were on the
 margin of buying in the baseline and did not because they anticipated the
 possibility of a move are now tipped over the balance and buy, because
 moving got very costly.
 The implied welfare equalizing consumption subsidy is 12% of period consumption.

This means that for the second data moment, for example, 40 year-olds from
 1998 contributed as well as 40 year-olds from the 2012 cohort.
 Needless to say, those cohorts faced a different sequence of house price
 shocks leading up the point of observation.
 For individuals 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

born
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 before the first data period, i.e.
 1998, I construct regional house price and regional income series going
 back until 1968.
 Simulating individuals from the 1968 cohort for a full lifetime of J=30
 years until the reach age 50 brings them into the year 1998, where they
 form the group of 50 year-olds in that particular year.
 This sort of staggered simulation is carried out until the final cohort
 is born in 2012 at age 20.
 No simulation needs to take place for any individual alive at years after
 2012.

In a first step I estimate the marginal distributions of 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{idt}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{ikt+1}$
\end_inset

 for all movers.
 These are the cross-sectional distributions of residuals 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{it}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{it+1}$
\end_inset

 from the regression in expression 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:copula-margins-1"

\end_inset

, which is estimated for all movers.
 The move takes place in period 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, such that by assumption, 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{it}$
\end_inset

 is the residual wage in origin location 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{it+1}$
\end_inset

 is the residual wage in the new location 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\ln y_{idt}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}\text{college}_{it}+\delta p(\text{age}_{it})+\beta_{2}\text{numkids}_{it}+\beta_{3}\text{sex}_{it}+\beta_{4}\text{metro}_{it}+\gamma_{d}+u_{it}\label{eq:copula-margins-1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\text{age})$
\end_inset

 is a third order polynomial in age, metro is an indicator for metropolitan
 status and 
\begin_inset Formula $\gamma_{d}$
\end_inset

 is a Division fixed effect.
 Then I convert the residuals into their respective rank in the empirical
 distributions of before and after move residuals.
 Denoting the standardized values by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\hat{u}_{it},\hat{u}_{it+1}\right)$
\end_inset

, the next step involves fitting the a normal copula via maximum likelihood
 to this data.
 The results are shown in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Normal-Copula-estimates"

\end_inset

, and they indicate a correlation between 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{u}_{it}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{u}_{it+1}$
\end_inset

 of 0.59.
 This estimate together with the marginal distibutions of 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{it}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{it+1}$
\end_inset

 are used in the structural model, where I use the current value of 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

, evaluated in the marginal distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{it}$
\end_inset

 for a mover together with the copula estimate 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{G}_{\text{move}}$
\end_inset

 to draw the next value of 
\begin_inset Formula $z'$
