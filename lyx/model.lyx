JOB MARKET PAPER
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
I propose a lifecycle model of consumption, savings, homeownership and location
 choice to investigate the interaction of housing with regional migration
 decisions in the USA.
 Labor income and house price risk have an important impact on consumer
 welfare, and shocks to both are correlated at the aggregate and regional
 level.
 This leads to different implications for owners and renters, not only because
 of their differing balance sheets, but also because the former are less
 mobile than the latter.
 The paper asks two questions: First, is government housing policy an effective
 lever to affect migration, and if so, to which extent? Second, how valuable
 is regional migration in terms of consumer welfare when there are large
 regional shocks? Regarding the first question, I analyse the role of the
 US mortgage interest deduction on migration behaviour and find that abolishing
 it would increase the migration rate by 2.5%, corresponding to a 5% increase
 in per-period consumption.
 Concerning the second point, the model predicts that doubling the moving
 cost implies a 1.2% reduction in per-period consumption.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Homeownership and the likelihood of moving across regions are negatively
 correlated.
 This negative correlation has important implications when considering the
 insurance mechanisms available to consumers in the face of regional shocks
 to housing and labor productivity in a world of incomplete markets.
 The possiblity of moving to another region in the event of a shock is a
 way to self insure.
 The aim of this paper is firstly to investigate the value of this self
 insurance mechanism in terms of welfare, and secondly to establish whether
 changing government housing policy to abolish the mortgage interest rate
 deduction is an effective lever to increase migration rates.
 To address both issues, I propose a lifecycle model of consumption and
 savings, housing tenure and location choice, with aggregate uncertainty
 which affects prices in regions differentially.
 The differential impact of aggregate shocks by region allows migration
 to serve a partial insurance device.
 Taking a lifecycle perspective is necessary to account for a strong age
 effect in both mobility and ownership, which has implications for welfare
 statements about policies, since different age groups will be affected
 differently.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Government policy plays an important role in both housing and labor markets.
 In a US context, housing policies such as the mortgage interest tax deduction,
 the backing of mortgages originated through government sponsored agencies
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as well as zoning restrictions and building
 regulations all have profound impacts on the incentives consumers face
 in the housing market.
 Each of those policies may have been implemented originally in part to
 address a certain economic inefficiency in housing and capital markets
 (e.g.
 a shortage of housing after the second World War and moral hazard concerns
 may have warranted a down payment for mortgages, creating liquidity constraints
 that warranted government backing to provide cheaper mortgages) and in
 part to respond to political pressures of the day (e.g.
 the desire of the median voter for large suburban houses and cheap commuting
 into town), and there is a well-informed debate in economics about the
 the desireability of each of them (see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "glaeser2011rethinking"

\end_inset

).
 What is less well understood is how those policies interact with regional
 mobility when economic shocks occur, which is one of the contributions
 made by this paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In 2013, 63% of occupied housing units in the US are owned, while 37% are
 rented.

\end_layout

\end_inset

 At the same time, roughly 1.3% of the population migrate across US census
 division boundaries per year.
 This number is composed of 1.9% of renters and 0.67% owners who move.
 These are large differences in the propensity to move, and the natural
 question to ask is why do we observe owners moving less? All else equal,
 owners face higher moving costs, both in terms of financial as well as
 time and effort costs.
 Financial costs occur because of transaction costs in the housing market
 upon sale of the house (e.g.
 agency fees or transaction taxes), while costs of effort arise from owners
 having to spend time finding a suitable buyer, meet with agents and lawyers
 etc.
 A comparable renter is subject to those costs only to a lesser degree,
 if at all.
 Additional to greater moving costs, by buying a house owners make a specific
 investment into an asset that provides both a stream of utlility and a
 financial return, but is tied to a location.
 The stream of utility is only available if they reside in that location,
 and transaction costs imply that switching houses is costly, making owners
 more reluctant to move.
 Finally, it is conceivable that there is an interaction between a location
 preference and the decision to buy a house in the first place.
 My model incorporates all of the aforementioned factors influencing the
 housing and mobility choices of individuals and it allows for this potential
 interaction in preferences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the model I develop, there are several mechanims which affect the home
 ownership choice of individuals.
 A downpayment requirement means that only individuals with sufficient cash
 on hand are able to buy a house at the current price.
 Even though all individuals share a common preference for owning, not all
 will buy a house once the downpayment constraint is satisfied.
 This decision depends on individual specific costs of moving, implying
 that high cost types are more likely to own and less likely to move.
 Finally, regional variation in price to income ratios imply different ownership
 rates in different regions, reflecting the relative differences found in
 the data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In terms of the decision to migrate to another region, the model predicts
 that the likelihood of migration is increasing in the difference of discounted
 expected lifetime utilities between any two regions.
 Those relative utilities, in turn, depend on the average regional income
 level and the level of regional house prices, both of which vary over time.
 Allowing regional characteristics to vary is a significant contribution
 to the literature on dynamic migration models such as for example 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kennan2003effect"

\end_inset

, since it provides a reason for agents to move in response to a change
 in their economic environment, rather than as a result of idiosyncratic
 preference shocks alone.
 Including time-varying location characteristics, however, increases computation
al demands substantially.
 The model features a factor structure which allows aggregate shocks to
 affect regions differently, and at the same time helps to preserve computationa
l tractability.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I estimate the model using a simulated method of moments estimator.
 I find that the model fits the data very well along the main dimensions
 of interest, which are mobility and ownership patterns over the lifecycle,
 ownership rates by region, as well as wealth accumulation over the lifecycle
 and by region.
 After fitting the model to the data, I first perform some comparative statics
 exercises and then move on to counterfactual policy simulations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The comparative statics illustrate the reaction of migration rates with
 respect to large regional shocks to either labor income or house prices.
 The impulse responses differ depending on the direction of migratory flows
 (i.e.
 whether we consider in or out migration) and on ownership status.
 For example, conditional on being able to buy in a region, the immigration
 rate of owners is positively related to a change in house price, since
 their utility depends on the net present value of the housing investment,
 which is positively related to price.
 The opposite is true for renters, whose utility depends on the level of
 rents, which in turn depends on the house price, thus renter immigration
 is negatively related to a price increase in a given region.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regarding policy experiments, I'm interested in the effectiveness of policies
 which might increase labor mobility across regions with the ultimate aim
 to enhance labor market efficiency.
 Moving costs as well as liquidity constraints and imperfect rental markets
 are the main inefficiencies a government may want to address in this context.
 For example, I find that abolishing the mortgage interest deduction would
 have a small positive impact on the migration rate.
 At first sight one might be tempted to think that removing the deduction
 would result in more renters, which would translate into an increase in
 migration, since renters move more.
 The actual effect is more nuanced.
 First of all, relative moving probabilities change as the policy is enacted.
 Owning becomes a less attractive option, which decreases the incentives
 to search for a better housing market.
 Secondly, there is a general equilibrium effect at play which reduces equilibri
um house prices.
 The interest rate deduction is a subsidy that is capitalized into house
 values, so removing it will reduce prices.
 In order to account for this general equilibrium effect to some extent
 in the realm of my partial equilibrium model, I use recent results from
 a stationary GE model by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "sommer2013implications"

\end_inset

 to adjust prices after the policy is changed.
 Applying the price correction further attenuates the initially expected
 positive effect on migration, since lower prices allow more people to buy,
 thereby increasing the ownership rate.
 The change in the migration rate is of the order of 0.1 percentage points
 (corresponding to a 7.7% increase in the migration rate), depending on the
 way revenue neutrality is enforced and whether prices are adjusted.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second experiment investigates the effects of a government policy which
 directly affects the moving decision by altering the moving cost.
 The results of this highlight that moving costs are of first order importance
 for migration decisions, but that they also affect housing choices.
 Reducing moving costs to half their baseline level results in an increase
 in the annual moving rate of 13.7 and 2.7 percentage points for renters and
 owners, respectively.
 The ownership rate decreases by 6.1 percentage points.
 Agents in the model would forgo 12% of annual consumption under this new
 regime and be indifferent to the baseline.
 When increasing the moving cost to double its baseline level, the migration
 rates go to virtually zero, and ownership increases by 1.8 percentage points.
 Agents would demand an annual increase in consumption of 1.2% under this
 regime before being indifferent to the baseline.

, who study the determinants of individual migration decisions across US
 states in a dynamic partial equilibrium model, with a particular focus
 on the importance of return migration.
 Their main finding is that expected income is an important determinant
 of migration decisions.
 My paper adds to their setup a homeownership choice, and time-varying regional
 income and price levels, which they implicitly assume fixed throughout.
 Adding the ownership choice does justice to a stark separation of owners
 and renters in the data with respect to their relative migration behaviour;
 allowing regional prices to vary gives agents in the model a fundamental
 economic reason to migrate, i.e.
 as the economic fortunes in a region change, so does the migration behaviour
 of people from and to that region.

 He argues that public policy which encourages ownership through subsidy
 or building restrictions moves people away from dense, urban neighborhoods
 with predominatly rental accomodation and into suburban areas with owner
 occupied housing and long associated commutes.
 This is a distortion of a market where the need for public intervention
 is not obvious even after close scrutiny, and it affects inner city economic
 development and has large environmental consequences, reenforcing the need
 for policy change in the view of Glaeser.

 is a paper which fed into this conclusion, analysing the benefits of the
 home mortgage interest deduction.
 In it, the authors use a measure of the tax benefit to owners arising from
 the mortgage interest rate deduction similar to the one used in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Poterba:2008fk"

\end_inset

.
 They find that based on this measure, it seems there is no impact of the
 amount of the deduction on the aggregate homeownership rate in time series
 data, but only on the amount of housing consumed.
 As pointed out in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Poterba:2008fk"

\end_inset

, it is indeed the case that the amount of tax savings is increasing in
 household income, as higher income households are more likely to itemize
 their tax return, which is a precondition for applying for the deduction;
 However, the average tax savings for a households are still significant
 in all age and income brackets, as evident in panel B of table 1 therein.

In a series of papers starting with

key "oswald1996conjecture"

\end_inset

 and leading up to 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "blanchflower2013does"

\end_inset

, the authors advance the theory that homeownership is an impediment to
 labor market mobility.
 Initially based on cross-country regressions and later on state--level
 cross sectional data for the US, they find a statistical relationship between
 current unemployment and past homeownership at a lag of up to five years.
 As poptential mechanisms they cite negative externalities of homeownership
 on the wider labor market, in particular greater NIMBYism (Not In My Back
 Yard) reducing business creation and productive investments and lower attractio
n of no migrants, who may be important for economic growth but demand rental
 accomodation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Providing a more structural approach to the link between homeownership and
 unemployment, there is a growing literature analyzing if and how the recent
 house price crash has affected the reallocation of workers across locations,
 or if it affected the unemployment rate.
 The mechanisms are a variant of negative equity lock-in and search frictions
 in housing and labor markets.

.
 At difference to those papers which focus on the equilibrium properties
 of housing and unemployment, here I spend a lot of effort in trying to
 model the budget constraint and instutional environment of a consumer as
 accurately as possible.
 In particular, age seems to be of first order importance in both housing
 and migration decisions in the data, which brings with it the need to consider
 a finite time horizon, implying that any mortgage taken out must be paid
 back at some point -- which is not implied by the previous set of papers.
 [NEED SOMETHING BETTER HERE] Furthermore, it seems that the dynamics of
 house prices over the last decade are hard to reconcile with equilibrium
 models of this kind, which is particularly worrying if the exercise is
 to deliver estimates of structural parameters, as is the aim here.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The contribution of this paper is to provide a link between models of housing
 demand over the lifecycle, as for example

\end_inset

, with the literature on dynamic migration following 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kennan2003effect"

\end_inset

.
 I find that housing is an important feature of the individual migration
 decision.
 The likelihood of any given move depends not only on whether or not the
 individual owns their house, but also on the price and income levels in
 all potential destination regions, including the current one, and the current
 level of mortgage debt.
 Regional shocks are important drivers of migration.

 moves between two out of four census regions, and about 1.3% move between
 states within any one region.
 At a more local level, they find that 5% of the population move between
 counties each year, which amounts to roughly one-third of the annual flows

To a first approximation, those regions represent areas with a common housing
 and labor market.
 In the model, a move within any region is not considered as migration and
 therefore does not contribute to the overall migration rate.
 This implies that when in this paper I refer to the effects of a certain
 policy on the migration rate at the census division level, this should
 be interpreted as a lower bound to the effects that would be found in a
 model where a lower level of geographic aggregation would be used, since
 there is a proportion of moves that do happen in the data, but which are
 not picked up by my geographic definition of a market.

The aggregation of states into this particular grouping is but one of many
 possibilities, and I adopt this particular partition based on computational
 constraints.
 In many respects the ideal concept of a region is what economists would
 refer to as a local labor market, and metropolitan statistical areas (MSA)
 or commuting zones (CZ) come close to this.
 Unfortunately, for the purpose of the model in this paper, the so--defined
 number of regions would be far too large to be computationally feasible.
 Hence the choice of census divisions.

The model presented below contains 25.4 million different points in the state
 space at which to solve a savings problem.
 Increasing the number of regions to 51 (to represent US states) increases
 this to 815 million points in the state space.
 Given that estimation requires evaluation of the model solution many times
 over, the former state space can be handled with code that is highly optimized
 for speed, while the latter cannot.

I combine four panels of SIPP data (1996, 2001, 2004 and 2008) into a database
 with 102,529 individuals that I can follow over time and space.
 From this dataset, a couple of interesting facts emerge.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Annual-moving-rate"

\end_inset

 presents some summary annual moving rates for both state and Census Division
 level migration.
 The overall unconditional migration rate is 1.95% and 1.32% per year for
 cross state and cross division, respectively.
 The cross state figure differs from the 2% in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Migration-rates-Molloy"

\end_inset

 because I set up the SIPP data in terms of household heads, thereby missing
 some moves of non--reference persons, and potentially because of sample
 attrition.
 It is quite clear from table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Annual-moving-rate"

\end_inset

 that there is a marked distinction in the likelihood of moving across state
 as well as division boundaries between renters and owners, with 2.6% (1.85%)
 of renters versus 0.93% (0.7%) of owners moving across state (division) boundarie
s on average per year.
 In total I observe of 2684 cross Division moves made by 2329 unique individuals
, implying multiple moves for some movers, see table

 I present estimates from a statistical analysis of the determinants of
 cross division moves from SIPP data.
 I regress a binary indicator for whether or not a cross division move took
 place in a given year on a set of explanatory variables which relate to
 the household in question in a probit regression.
 The table shows marginal effects computed at the sample mean of each variable,
 as well as the ratio of marginal effects to the baseline unconditional
 probability of moving (1.32%).
 The results indicate that there is a pronounced age effect, with each additiona
l year of age implying a reduction that is equal to 6% of the baseline probabili
ty.
 The same effect is found for whether or not children are present in the
 household.
 The effect of being a homeowner is very large and equivalent to a reduction
 in the propensity to move of 51% of the baseline probability.
 Increasing household income by $100,000 is equivalent to a 5% baseline
 baseline increase.
 Finally, having a college degree has an effect of equal magnitude than
 being a homeowner, but in the opposite direction: a college degree amounts
 to an increase of the baseline of 49%.
 According to this model, the effect of being a homeowner on the baseline
 moving probability is equal to an age increase of 8.3 years, thus taking
 a 30-year old to age 38; also, a household which owns the house would have
 to experience an increase in household income of $1m in order to make up
 for the implied loss in the probability of moving across divisions from
 being an owner.
 The house price to income ratio does not play a significant role in this
 specification.

Model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the model I view households as a single unit, and I'll use the terms
 
\emph on
household 
\emph default
and 
\emph on
individual
\emph default
 interchangeably in what follows.
 Individuals are assumed to live in census Division (or 
\emph on
region
\emph default
) 
\begin_inset Formula $d\in D$
\end_inset

 for a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 years of age.
 At each age 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, individual 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 has to decide whether to move to a different region, whether to own or
 rent, and how much of his labor income to save.
 Individuals derive utility from consumption 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

, from owning a house 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

 and an unobservable location preference shock.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Individuals are subject to uncertainty at both the aggregate and individual
 level.
 At the aggregate level, regional house price 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and income levels 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{y}$
\end_inset

 fluctuate.
 This allows some scope for regional migration as an insurance mechanism.
 The regional fluctuations are driven by a common set of low dimensional
 stochastic factors denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

.
 This reflects the fact the regional shocks to both house prices and average
 labor income are highly correlated.
 It also allows for fluctuations in the underlying aggregate factors 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 to have differential impacts across regions, while maintaining a degree
 of computational tractability.
 Every individual in region 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 faces an identical level of house price 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{dt}$
\end_inset

 and mean income 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{y}_{dt}$
\end_inset

 at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

.
 In addition to that, 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{y}_{dt}$
\end_inset

 enters the individual wage equation as a level shifter.
 At the individual level uncertainty enters the model through an idiosyncratic
 component of income risk, a Markovian process that models changes in household
 size over the lifecycle, and a location--specific preference shock, which
 is assumed identically and independently distributed across agents, regions
 and time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The job search process is modeled as in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kennan2003effect"

.
 Individuals do not know the exact wage they will earn in the new location.
 The new wage is composed of a deterministic, and thus predictable, part
 and a component that is random.
 Over and above an expectation about some prevailing average level of wages
 the mover can expect in any given region at time 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, it is impossible to be certain about the exact match quality of the new
 job ex ante.
 The new job can be viewed as an experience good where quality is revealed
 only after an initial period.
 This setup gives rise to income risk associated with moving.

 capital 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{dt}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $q(i,t)$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
y_{idt} & = & w_{dt}q(i,t)\\
w_{dt} & = & \left(\overline{y}_{dt}\right)^{\eta_{d}}\\
q(i,t) & = & \exp(f(t)+z_{it})
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $f(t)$
\end_inset

 is a deterministic age effect and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{it}$
\end_inset

 stands for an individual specific persistent idiosyncratic shock.
 The coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\eta_{d}$
\end_inset

 allows for differential transmission of regional shocks into individual
 income by region 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the logarithm of labor income of individual 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 at age 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 residing in region 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}

z_{it} & = & \rho z_{it-1}+e_{it-1}\nonumber \\

\begin_layout Standard
The price of human capital 
\begin_inset Formula $w_{dt}$
\end_inset

 differs by region to reflect different industry compositions by region,
 which are taken as given.
 Underlying this is an assumption about non--equalizing factor prices across
 regions.
 It is plausible to think that within a single country, wages should tend
 to converge to a common level, particularly in the presence of large migratory
 flows from one region to the next.
 In assuming no relative factor price equalization across US regions I rely
 on a host of evidence showing that relative wages vary considerably across
 regions over a long time horizon (see for example

 Additional to that, in order to buy a proportion

 This constraint must be satisfied in each period, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{t+1}\geq-(1-\chi)p_{dt},\forall t$

Moving Costs.

\begin_layout Standard
Moving across locations is assumed to be costly in terms of utility.
 Denote 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta(d,x)$
\end_inset

 the utility costs of moving from 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 at a current value of the state vector 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 (defined below).
 Moving costs differ between renters and owners.
 Moving for an owner requires to sell the house, which in turn requires
 some effort and time costs.
 This is on top of any other psychological costs incurred from moving states
 which are common between renters and owners.
 I specify the moving cost function as linear in parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\Delta(d,x)=\alpha_{0,\tau}+\alpha_{1}h_{it-1}+\alpha_{2}t_{it}+\alpha_{3}t_{it}^{2}+\alpha_{4}s_{it}\label{eq:moving-cost}

The consumer faces a nested optimization problem in each period.
 At the lower level, optimal savings and housing decision must be taken
 conditional on any discrete location choice, and at the upper level the
 discrete location choice with the maximal value is chosen.
 It is useful to define the conditional value function 
\begin_inset Formula $v\left(x,k\right)$
\end_inset

, which represents the optimal value after making housing and consumption
 choices at state 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

 The conditional value function

\begin_inset Formula $d$

 This formulation conveniently nests all discrete location choice configurations

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 is a result of the distributional assumption on 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

, which admits a closed form expression of the expected value function,
 whereby 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\gamma}\approx0.577$
\end_inset

 is Euler's constant.

v_{t}\left(x_{it},k\right) & = & \max_{c_{it}>0,h_{it}\in\left\{ 0,1\right\} }u(c_{it},h_{it},d_{it},k)+\beta\mathbb{E}_{z,s,\mathbf{P}}\left[\overline{v}_{t+1}\left(x_{it+1}\right)|z_{it},s_{it},\mathbf{P}_{t}\right]\label{eq:v}\\

 & = & \overline{\gamma}+\ln\left(\sum_{k=1}^{J}\exp\left(v_{t}\left(x_{it},k\right)\right)\right)\label{eq:vbar}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

Another convient by-product of the Type 1 EV assumption is that there is
 a closed form expression for the conditional choice probability of making
 a move from

 Buyers can borrow against the value of their house and are required to

 This is embedded in constraint

Owners.

\begin_layout Standard
For individuals entering the period as owners 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(h_{it-1}=1\right)$
\end_inset

, the budget constraint is similar except for two differences which relate
 to the borrowing constraint and transfers in case they sell the house.
 Owners are not required to make a scheduled mortgage payment -- a gradual
 reduction of debt, i.e.
 an increase in 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

, arises naturally from the terminal condition 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{iT}+p_{dT}h_{iT-1}>0$
\end_inset

, as mentioned above.
 Therefore the budget of the owner is only affected by the house price in
 case they decide to sell the house, i.e.
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $h_{it}=0$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, they obtain the house price net of the proportional selling
 cost 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi$

The budget constraint for moving owners depends on the house price in both

 since the house in the current region must be sold by assumption.
 The expression

\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 relates to proceeds from sale of the house in region 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

, whereas the square brackets describe expenditures in region 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 Notice also that the borrowing constraint 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:budget-own-borrow-1"

\end_inset

 now is a function of the value of the new house in 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 It is important to note that this formulation precludes moving with negative
 equity if labor income is not enough to cover it.
 This is exacerbated in cases where the mover wants to buy immediately in
 the new region, since in that case the downpayment needs to be made as
 well, i.e.
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{idt}<a_{it}+(1-\phi)p_{dt}-\chi h_{it}p_{kt}$
\end_inset

 then the budget set is empty and moving and buying is infeasible.

 Accounting for this subset of the population would require to 1) assume

 For those reasons the model cannot account for this subset of the mover

Estimation

\begin_layout Standard
In this section I explain how the model is estimated to fit some features
 of the data.
 There is a set of preset model parameters, the values of which I either
 take from other papers in the literature or I estimate them outside of
 the structural model and treat them as inputs.
 The remaining set of parameters are estimated using the simulated method
 of moments (SMM) approach, whereby given a set of parameters, the model
 is used to compute decision rules of agents, which in turn are used to
 simulate artificial data.
 A set of summarizing features from the artificial data should then be close
 to the same features of the the real data.
 The parameter vector to be estimated by SMM contains the parameters of
 the moving cost function (
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

), the coefficient of relative risk aversion 
\begin_inset Formula $(\gamma)$
\end_inset

, the parameters of the final period value function 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\omega_{1},\omega_{2}\right)$

\begin_inset Formula $(\pi_{\tau})$
\end_inset

, and the utility derived from housing for both household sizes, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\xi(0),\xi(1)\right)$
\end_inset

My estimation sample is formed out of averages over SIPP data moments covering
 the period 1997--2012.
 Averaging over years was necessary to preserve a reasonable sample size
 in all conditioning cells.
 However, it also introduces an initial conditions and cohort effects problem,
 since, for example, a 30-year-old in 1997 faced a different economic environmen
t over their lifecycle than a similar 30-year-old in 2012 would have.
 The challenge is to construct an artificial dataset from simulated data,
 which has the same time and age structure as the sample taken from the
 data -- in particular, agents in the model should have faced the same sequence
 of aggregate shocks as their data counterparts.
 This requires to simulate individuals starting in different calendar years,
 taking into account the actual observed time series for regional house
 prices and incomes.
 I describe the proceedure in detail in the appendix.

A copula is a multivariate probability distribution function which connects
 univariate margins by taking into account the underlying dependence structure.
 For example, a finite state Markov transition matrix is a nonparametric
 approximation to a bivariate copula, and they converge as the number of
 states goes to infinity, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_layout

\end_inset

 To estimate the parameters of the copula, I view 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{idt}$
\end_inset

 in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:income-process"

\end_inset

 as the residual from an ordinary least squares regression of log wages
 on time and region effects, as well as person specific demographic predictors.
 The question is whether individuals with a particularly high residual 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{idt}$
\end_inset

 are likely to have a high residual 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{ikt+1}$
\end_inset

 after their move to region 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, we want to investigate the joint distribution of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(z_{idt},z_{ikt+1}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 In a first step I estimate the marginal distributions, which is just the
 cross-sectional distribution of both margins.
 Unsurprisingly, both margins are close to normal, which indicates a well-specif
ied regression model.
 The next step involves fitting the copula via maximum likelihood to those
 data.
 The results indicate that there is a relatively high degree of dependence
 in the residual, with the estimated copula parameter of the order of 0.7.
 This estimate is in line with a simple correlation measure between 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{idt}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{ikt+1}$
\end_inset

 in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Notice also that the correlation is smaller than then one observed in the
 period preceding the move.

In this section I use model to illustrate several mechanisms which are implied
 by the inclusion of homeownership status and assets into the state space
 of a dynamic migration model à la 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "kennan2003effect"

\end_inset

.
 Before going into greater detail, it is worth pointing out that owners
 and renters have opposed incentives with regards to house prices, which
 will be a recurring theme in the following.
 The opposing incentives are a result of the specification of the final
 period value function, which depends on home equity.
 This implies that, all else equal, owners prefer higher prices, while renters
 prefer lower ones.
 This has to do with renters' desire to become owners (which is more difficult
 with higher prices given the downpayment constraint) and higher rents associate
d with higher prices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will now discuss how the probability of migrating varies over the state
 space along the asset, income, and ownership status dimensions.
 In order to help this discussion, it is useful to briefly refer to an example
 with two discrete choices 
\begin_inset Formula $j=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j=2$
\end_inset

 and consider the effects on the probability of choosing option 
\begin_inset Formula $j=1$
\end_inset

 as the associated value, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}$
\end_inset

, varies.
 This will enable us to better relate changes in the state space of the
 model, which affect the relative values of any given location (e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}$
\end_inset

), to changes in moving probabilities.
 Let us start therefore with figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Illustration-of-conditional"

\end_inset

, which plots the conditional choice probability function 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:prob-of-moving"

\end_inset

 for the simplified case of 
\begin_inset Formula $D=2$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 for two regions.
 Denoting the lifetime utilities in each region by 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{2}$
\end_inset

, and fixing 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{2}=1$
\end_inset

, we are interested in how the probability of moving to region 
\begin_inset Formula $j=1$
\end_inset

 changes as the 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}$
\end_inset

 is changed.
 It is clear that if 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}=v_{2}$
\end_inset

, the probability of moving is 0.5, and it is increasing along the sigmoid
 curve in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Illustration-of-conditional"

\end_inset

 in the difference 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}-v_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 In the examples to follow, changes in the differences 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{d}-v_{k}$
\end_inset

 determine changes to the aggregate moving probability.
 It is clear that, given the nonlinear nature of any given value function
 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

, those change will be nonlinear over the state space.

 and 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 I plot the conditional mean of the moving probability function 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:prob-of-moving"

\end_inset

, conditioning on quantiles of the state space variables assets 
\begin_inset Formula $(a)$
\end_inset

, income 
\begin_inset Formula $(y)$
\end_inset

, income shock 
\begin_inset Formula $(z)$
\end_inset

, and housing status 
\begin_inset Formula $(h)$
\end_inset

.
 The plots show throughout a marked difference by housing status 
\begin_inset Formula $h$
\end_inset

, which is fully expected given the data.
 Perhaps more interesting is the shape of the average moving rate over the
 space of assets, which shows different probabilities throughout.
 For example, not only is the probability higher for renters almost everywhere,
 it is also declining as assets increase.
 Since households in the model build up assets in order to buy, this shows
 that for renters with higher assets (thus closer to being an owner), the
 likelihood of moving away is lower.
 Observing high asset owners and renters with greater likelihood of moving
 shows that they are particularly mobile.
 The density is very small at high asset values.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
The effects on migration of a shock to the regional house price level
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section I illustrate how the model reacts to large economic shocks
 at the regional level.
 In particular, I present changes in migratory flows with respect to the
 baseline environment, when the regional price or income level is reduced
 unexpectedly at a certain point in time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I reduce the level of the house price in the Pacific division in 2007 by
 30% (Pacific has region index 
\begin_inset Formula $d=6$
\end_inset

).
 The experiment is conducted under the assumption that agents did not foresee
 the shock and therefore are surprised in 2007 to find that the mapping
 form aggregate factors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(Y,P\right)$
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $ $
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\left(\bar{y}_{6},p_{6}\right)$
\end_inset

 as defined in equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 does not apply anymore, since they observe 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{2007}\times p_{6,2007},\iota_{2007}=0.7$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{6,2007}=\mathbf{a}_{6}\mathbf{P}_{2007}$
\end_inset

, as predicted by the model.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
The surprise assumption is necessary to observe a causal effect of the price
 change, since otherwise the response of agents would be partially anticipating
 the shock.
 They immeditately adjust to the new mapping and behave optimally to the
 new sequence of prices in Pacific, i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \hat{p}_{6,t}\right\} _{t=2007}^{2012}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 I consider two scenarios, one where the shock is permanent thereafter,
 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{2007+t}=0.7,t=0,1,\dots$
\end_inset

, and a second one where the shock reverts back to trend over three years,
 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota=\left\{ 0.7,0.8,0.9,1.0,1.0,\dots\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The experiment highlights the different incentives to renters and owners
 to move to a given region, or to leave a region.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Starting with the case for current owners, I will focus here on the effect
 of owners who move into and subsequently decide to buy in Pacific.
 Their decision to move and buy is driven mainly by the long-term prospects
 for the housing investment.
 This is driven in part by the final period value function, which depends
 on the value of the house in the last period, and in part by the capital
 gains realized in case the house is sold.
 Therefore we would expect short-term and permanent shocks to have differential
 impacts on the respective decisions to move into Pacific and not.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:own-buy-p-perm"

\end_inset

 shows the case for the permanent price shock.
 We see that under the baseline the immigration rate of owners, who decide
 to buy, tracks the baseline house price curve as shown in the panel for
 Pacific in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Mapping-P-p"

\end_inset

.
 Owner/buyers here have a strong investment motive, where the value of owning
 in Pacific is strictly increasing in the house price.
 Comparing this to the shock scenario where the price is permanently reduced
 by 30%, the immigration rate drops dramatically: the price having dropped
 makes housing in Pacific appear as a much less worthwhile investment, and
 the rate at which owners who want to buy are moving into Pacific collapses.
 Notice that agents here have rational expectations about the fact that
 prices are not going to recover, as this is embedded in the expected future
 values they compute, now taking into account the lower future prices.

Contrasting this to the 3-year reverting price shock reveals a different
 picture.
 In this instance, the immigration rate of owners who buy in Pacific jumps
 to very high level relative to the baseline before reverting back in 2009--2010
, when the shock fades out.
 The interpretation of this is straightforward and has to do with above
 mentioned investment motives of owners: relative to the baseline, where
 prices in 2007 are close to their peak, a 30% reduction in the price level
 makes buying in Pacific a very sound investment for agents in the model.
 They expect prices to return to the levels implied by the current state
 of the aggregate factors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{P}_{2007}$
\end_inset

, which -- given the degree of persistence observed in that process -- means
 they expect high prices into the foreseeable future.
 According to the assumed expectations model, this is an investment with
 high expected return.

\begin_layout Standard
The response of renters who want to continue renting in Pacific tells a
 largely similar tale, albeit driven by different motivating factors.
 Renters in the model are renters only because they cannot afford the downpaymen
t.
 In other words, all agents in the model agree that owning a house is preferrabl
e to renting it.
 This in turn implies that if a household rents in a given location, they
 are likely to rent in another location, because their level of wealth has
 not changed.
 Of course this is conditional on the relative price difference between
 any two regions.
 Summing up, renters who want to continue renting are expected to care about
 the rent they have to pay in any given destination region.
 We would expect the immigration rate of renters to be negatively correlated
 to the level of prices (which affects rents).

Looking at figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:exp-p-rent-perm-to6"

\end_inset

, where I plot the response of moving renters to the permanent price shock
 in Pacific, we can see that after the shock arrives, the immigration rate
 more than doubles and stays at a permanently higher level relative to the
 baseline.
 This is driven by the higher levels of consumption and saving renters can
 afford in Pacific under the lower price scenario, which translate into
 higher levels of utility.

The corresponding case for the temporary shock to prices is again similar
 for renters and owners.
 The sudden drop in prices in 2007 makes Pacific a more desireable location
 to rent relative to other regions, and relative to the baseline, where
 the immigration of renters actually decreases as prices to towards their
 2008 peak.
 At difference to the case with a permanent shock, it is quite clear that
 the change in behaviour lasts only as long as the reduction in rent: as
 soon as the shock fades out in 2010, the immigration rate in baseline and
 shock scenario are the same.

The effects of a shock to the regional labor income level
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This experiment is analogous in spirit to the previous one.
 It is worth keeping in mind, however, that the regional factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{y}_{d,t}$
\end_inset

 enters with a factor loading into the log earnings equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:income-process"

\end_inset

, whereas the price effects enter directly into the budget constraints.
 Other than applying the 30% shock to the regional income level 
\begin_inset Formula $\overline{y}_{6,t}$
\end_inset

 instead of to prices, the experiment is set up identically with what regards
 assumptions about behaviour and expectations.
 In order to faciliate a comparison across experiments, I will discuss the
 results in the same order as in the price shock case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Starting therefore with the immigration rate of owners into the Pacific
 region, in figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:own-buy-y-perm"

\end_inset

 we can see that moving becomes less attractive for owners after the reduction
 of the income level.
 The channel through which this operates is clear, since a lower level of
 income at all ages and realizations of the idiosyncratic shock 
\begin_inset Formula $z_{it}$
\end_inset

 implies lower levels of consumption over the lifecycle, leading to lower
 utility and therefore lower attraction to Pacific.
 The fact that the shock is permanent means that the immigration rate does
 not revert back after 2010.

 effect goes in the opposite direction, and secondly that it is less pronounced.
 The no long-term effects from temporarily reduced income are smaller than
 the ones associated with the house price drop.
 This is due to very large capital gains on housing.

\begin_layout Standard
It is at this point worth taking stock of the effects of shocking regional
 level house price or income levels.
 Firstly, there is stark difference in responses depending on whether the
 shock is expected to last forever or only for a certain period.
 This is the case for all types of agents (owners as well as renters) and
 for the shocks applied to either regional variable price or income.
 Secondly, it is important to distinguish between renters and owners when
 appreciating the migratory response to regional shocks.
 Owners have different concerns than renters, relating mainly to their expectati
on about capital gains from selling the house in some future period or bequeatin
g it to their offspring.
 For example the effects of a drop in house prices triggers vastly different
 responses in immigration decisions from owners, depending on the length
 of the low-price period.
 In figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:own-buy-p-perm"

\end_inset

, where the shock is permanent, the immigration of owners drops to a permanently
 lower level because housing is not a good investment; in constrast to that,
 figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:own-buy-p3"

\end_inset

 shows the case where the price drop is temporarily, causing great numbers
 of people to move into the region to take advantage of the current low
 prices, which are expected to recover after 3 years.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Reducing the price variance
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this subsection I investigate the effect of regional variation in house
 prices on migration and ownership decisions.
 We will compare the baseline model to a scenario where the variance in
 regional prices is greatly reduced, and therefore house prices are close
 to the aggregate factor 
\begin_inset Formula $P_{t}$
\end_inset

.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Compressing-the-regional"

\end_inset

 visualizes the price transformation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'll first refer to the overall effects in aggregate ownership and mobility
 rates with the help of table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:compress-summary"

\end_inset

 and will then discuss the underlying mechanisms in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:compress-mechanisms"

\end_inset

.
 In the first row of table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:compress-summary"

\end_inset

 we note that the compression in prices leads to fewer high price regions
 around 2007, thereby allowing more households to buy.
 This is reflected in an increase of the ownership rate.
 Secondly, we see that the unconditional migration rate increases slightly
 by 0.1 percentage point.
 This increase is driven exclusively by greater mobility of renters, as
 is evident in the third row of the table.
 The fourth row shows that owners move less when prices are compressed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These effects are driven by a change in composition (fewer owners), and
 a change in migration behaviour due to the now different values of housing
 in each region.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:compress-mechanisms"

\end_inset

 lists the precentage change in migratory moves on behalf of renters and
 owners 
\emph on
to
\emph default
 any given region, where the change is defined as 
\begin_inset Formula $\%\Delta_{d}=100\times\frac{m'_{d}-m_{d}}{m_{d}}$
\end_inset

, with 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{d},m'_{d}$
\end_inset

 denoting the migration rate into 
\begin_inset Formula $d$
\end_inset

 before and after the price compression.
 The columns labelled 
\begin_inset Formula $y,\frac{p}{y}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{\hat{p}}{y}$
\end_inset

 show the average regional income level (unchanged), and the price to income
 ratio before and after the price compression took place.
 One can relate the changes in immigration to a region to changes in those
 variables.
 For example, the Pacific region, which used to be very attractive for owners
 because of strong price growth looses it's appeal, and proportion of owners
 moving into Pacific decreases by 52%.
 At the same time, Pacific is relatively desireable for renters, with average
 income 
\begin_inset Formula $y=44$
\end_inset

 and now lower rents, therefore renter immigration increases by almost 50%.
 The effects are not linear in any sense, however, as the case of New England
 illustrates: this region was subject to the same reduction in house price
 as Pacific, the question therefore arises why there is an increase in owners
 moving there.
 The answer lies in the average income level, which is unchanged and remains
 the highest overall.
 This, combined with the fact that even after the compression, New England
 is the second highest house price region in the economy means that owners
 shift from moving to Pacific and into New England.

Abolishing the Mortgage Interest Deduction

\begin_layout Standard
In the US, homeowners are allowed to deduct the interest paid on the mortgage

 This reduces the user cost of owning and results in a subsidy of owner-occupied
 accomodation.

 the mortgage interest deduction, which is the largest housing policy policy
 program in the states, was $71.7 billion in 2014

It is often held that if there were an offsetting taxation of imputed rent
 which owner-occupiers pay to themselves in place, the negative aspects
 of the subsidy could be greatly reduced.
 Implementing such taxes is politically difficult in most circumstances,
 probably highlighted by the small number of nations which have adopted
 some form of this tax.

 The common wisdom is that it distorts the housing market by subsidizing
 owners, thereby leading to a higher rate of ownership as would arise without
 the subsidy.
 As discussed at length above, owners are less mobile than renters, so the
 question investigated in this subsection is whether abolishing the mortgage
 interest deduction would increase mobility, and if so, by how much.
 The answer to this question provides some guidance on whether housing policy
 could serve as an effective means to enhance the efficiency of the labor
 market by fostering greater mobility, or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At this point it is important to emphasize that depending on the elasticity
 of housing supply in a given market, we expect to see a general equilibrium
 effect of house prices in response to the policy change.
 The subsidy implied by the interest deduction can be viewed much like a
 characteristic of the house, like for instance distance to schools, or
 access to transportation networks.
 As such, it is capitalized into house prices in the baseline.
 Therefore, removing the subsidy would change long-run equilibrium prices,
 in the same way as moving a certain property to a location with a different
 set of available amenities would change its value.
 In order to partially accomodate this effect, I will refer to the recent
 paper by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "sommer2013implications"

\end_inset

, in which the authors compute the stationary general equilibrium in a model
 with infinitely lived, heterogeneous agents who are either renters, owner-occup
iers or owner-landlords.
 They compute equilibrium prices and rents arising from different assumption
 about the tax system.
 They find that house prices decrease on the order of 5% when the mortgage
 interest deduction is abolished, with rents keeping roughly constant and
 the homeownership rate increases from 65% to 71%.
 The mechanism is as follows: removing the subsidy lowers the equilibrium
 house price, since this is no longer capitalized into the value of the
 house; lower house prices makes housing affordable to more low wealth people
 who couldn't buy before, thereby increasing the ownership rate.
 Their model does not feature multiple labor or housing markets, and resting
 on the stationary equilibrium concept it does not allow for variation in
 house prices over time as is the case here; nevertheless, using their result
 to adjust the level of house prices by 5% in all locations when removing
 the mortgage deduction seems like a worthwhile exercise to at least approximate
 a potential general equilibrium effect in my model.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experiment is implemented as follows.
 The model being in after tax terms, it does not feature a formal tax system
 which could be changed in an experiment.
 The role of taxes and, in general, the user cost of housing is subsumed
 in the implicit mortgage repayment path brought about by the final period
 restriction on assets, as explained in section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Home-Ownership-Choice"

\end_inset

.
 In reality the interest rate deduction reduces taxable income, thereby
 increasing disposable income of owners.
 Therefore, to simulate the removal of the deduction, I reduce disposable
 income of owners by an amount equivalent to their average implied tax savings.
 To do this I use data from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Poterba:2008fk"

\end_inset

, which provides estimates of the average tax savings from the interest
 deduction for several income and age brackets.

\begin_layout Standard
To provide some guidance, it is useful to start with a simple calculation
 to gauge the likely effect of the policy change on migration rates under
 the assumption that the conditional choice probabilities (i.e.
 whether to move or not) in the model do not change.
 To simplify the example, let's assume that the baseline ownership rate
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{o}=0.6$
\end_inset

, and that the annual migration rates for owners and renters are given by
 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{o}=0.7$
\end_inset

% and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{r}=2\%$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 This would give rise to a baseline unconditional migration rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{o}m_{o}+(1-\pi_{o})m_{r}=1.22\%$
\end_inset

.
 Assuming that the conditional choice probabilities which give rise to 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{o}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{r}$
\end_inset

 do not change due to the policy change, and assuming, for example, that
 removing the subsidy reduces the ownership rate by 3% such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{o}'=0.57$
\end_inset

, we would expect to see a new migration rate of 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi_{o}'m_{o}+(1-\pi_{o}')m_{r}=1.259\%$
\end_inset

, implying an increase in the migration rate of 0.04 percentage points (or
 3.1%).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The choice probabilities do change after the policy is implemented for various
 reasons.
 Without a GE price adjustment, removing the subsidy makes housing less
 desirable.
 This affects owners and renters alike because the value of housing is an
 important determinant for lifetime utility.
 In the case of owners this is obvious as they receive a stream of utility
 from the house and a final period payoff from accumulated equity.
 For renters the same holds, because the majority of them will be owners
 at some point in their lifecycle, so their expected utility depends on
 the expected value of housing.
 Therefore, removing the subsidy lowers the incentives to move to a more
 profitable housing market.
 A different way to see this is to look at the conditional choice probability
 function 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:prob-of-moving"

\end_inset

 and realize that reducing all components by the same amount 
\begin_inset Formula $b>0$
\end_inset

 results in a lower probability of moving for the same difference in values
 
\begin_inset Formula $\epsilon$
\end_inset

, by the shape of the exponential function.
 I provide a simple example in the appendix.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Plain Layout
instead of lowering all values by 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

, the policy will affect the conditional values 
\begin_inset Formula $v(x,k)$
\end_inset

 differentially because even though the same monetary amount is involved
 in each region (i.e.
 cash on hand changes in exactly the same way), the implications for choice
 behaviour differ across regions.
 For example, an increase in cash 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{x}$
\end_inset

 may lead a renter to buy in region 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 but not in region 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
I conduct the experiment under three different scenarious concerning how
 the raised tax revenue is to be redistributed.
 The results are listed in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Abolishing-the-mortgage"

\end_inset

.
 Scenario (1) is an unrealistic benchmark where no redistribution takes
 place at all, and resources are destroyed (the money is burnt).
 Scenario (2) is a scheme that distributes the generated receipts on a per-capit
a, per-period basis.
 The final scheme (3) is identical to policy (2) but adds the GE price correctio
n as referred to above.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the table and starting with scenario (1), we see that removing
 the subsidy without any compensation decreases the ownership rate by 6%.
 This is a result of shifting owners, who are at the margin in the baseline
 scenario, into the renter population by making owning more expensive.
 The migration rate increases slightly by 1.5%.
 This policy results in a decrease in expected lifetime utility, and agents
 in the model would be indifferent to the baseline if they were compensated
 by a 2.7% increase of annual consumption.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Scenario (2) redistributes the taxes saved by removing the subsidy to the
 population on a per capita, per period basis.
 In other words, for total tax revenue 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

, each individual receives 
\begin_inset Formula $X/(TN)$
\end_inset

 additional dollars per period.
 This scheme approximates a reduction in income taxes financed by the removal
 of the mortgage subsidy.
 The redistribution means that fewer marginal owners are priced out of the
 ownership pool such that the ownership rate decreases by 5.2%.
 Similarly, given that incomes are higher in all regions and housing is
 a less bad option than in scenario (1), the migration rate increases by
 2.3%.
 Given the compensation, individuals are close to indifferent between this
 policy and the baseline, with the implied consumption increase amounting
 to 0.2% of annual consumption.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally let's look at scenario (3), where we apply the 5% GE house price
 reduction.
 Here agents are compensated in two complementary ways, i.e.
 through lower house prices and additional income.
 As a result, the ownership rate increases by 1.4%, and the migration rate
 reaches 2.5%.
 As before, the higher migration rate comes from greater incentives to exploit
 differences in relative utilities.
 Agents strongly prefer this policy to the baseline, and accordingly would
 be happy to give up 5% of period consumption before they would be indifferent
 to the baseline.

In this set of experiments I assume there is a government policy that can
 affect the moving cost as implied by equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 In particular, I assume the government can affect a factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 that multiplies equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:moving-cost"

\end_inset

 to produce a proportionally different moving cost.
 In the first experiment, moving costs are reduced to half their level,
 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}=0.5$
\end_inset

, and in the second experiment they are doubled such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{2}=2$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

 refer to policy 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}=0.5$
\end_inset

, i.e.
 halfing the moving cost.
 Renters average mobility jumps to 16% of the population changing locations
 per period, owners increase from 1% to 3% of movers.
 Accordingly the ownership rate drops to 42%.
 The policy is very valuable in terms of welfare, with 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta=0.88$
\end_inset

 implying that agents in the baseline would be ready to give up 12% of period
 consumption if they were allowed to switch to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We see the opposite kind of effects if we perform the policy in the other
 direction, i.e.
 we increase the moving cost in policy 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{2}=2$
\end_inset

.
 Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:doubleMC"

\end_inset

 shows the results of this experiment, and we see that mobility of both
 renters and owners is reduced by a factor of 10.
 The homeownership rate increases, since some individuals who were on the
 margin of buying in the baseline and did not because they anticipated the
 possibility of a move are now tipped over the balance and buy, because
 moving got very costly.
 The implied welfare equalizing consumption subsidy is 12% of period consumption.

 Simulating individuals from the 1968 cohort for a full lifetime of J=30
 years until the reach age 50 brings them into the year 1998, where they
 form the group of 50 year-olds in that particular year.
 This sort of staggered simulation is carried out until the final cohort
 is born in 2012 at age 20.
 No simulation needs to take place for any individual alive at years after
 2012.
 The initial distribution of assets is drawn from the empirical distribution
